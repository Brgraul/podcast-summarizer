      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm pretty excited to talk to you today. You are a fan of remote work and I am a long-term fan of remote work and that's your area of expertise. And I'm curious just to kind of kick it off when you sit down to personally learn something new, when you're learning a new topic, what's your approach? Like how do you dig in and get after something new and complex? For me personally, I have to tie it back to something that I'm trying to solve in real life. So it can't just be like, Oh, I'm interested in this topic. I want to dive in. It has to be like, Oh, I'm solving X problem. And what can I learn about why in order to solve it better or have more information going into it? So that's kind of how I approach learning. Do you go after like a book or once you've got your problem space and you kind of understand why you're doing this in the first place, cause it's associated with some sort of real life actual problem and not just for the sake of learning, what do you do at that point? Is it all the five-star books on Amazon or what's your kind of approach? I go everywhere. I love diving fully in. So I'm, you know, I'm going into articles, I'm reading books. I might join a couple of course. I pretty much dive into everything. Are you a fan of online courses in general? Is that something that you make a habit of? And what are you looking for when you're out there seeking a new course for your own personal learning? I'm a huge fan of online courses because I really like learning at my own pace. And that really provides that. So it depends on the topic I'm looking at. I'll take various courses. So I've done cohort based courses that are live. I've done, you know, just standard recorded courses and everything in between. I think it depends on what I'm learning and what my aim is. So with live courses, if I need more accountability or if I'm looking to join a community and have that network, then I'm going to join a live course. If I actually want to learn the topic and really dive in there, then I'm most likely going to do a recorded course, just because that's how I learn best is in my own time with my own resources. You built a framework and I think that's interesting because not everybody sits down and builds frameworks or invents frameworks for how they work. Can you explain the work forward approach and what you did with this framework and why it exists? Yeah. So I founded a fractional head of remote company in 2018 called Remote Work Prep. And I would frequently go into companies and talk about asynchronous work. And there was this instant reaction negatively towards asynchronous work. They thought it might be slow. They thought it might be difficult. They just instantly had that reaction and that made it really hard to help them learn how to work effectively asynchronously because you're working against these preconceived notions. So instead I created a framework called the work forward approach that basically has eight principles that help people work asynchronously without having the asynchronous name attached to it. So I'm kind of jumping forward from those preconceived notions and instead diving into things that actually make sense to people and help them work asynchronously. I assume when you're coming up with something, because to me that reminds it like a framework is and developing a framework is probably related to instructional design and you've brought that forward and you're teaching a course now and I assume that has some sort of relation when you're thinking about that, when you're starting to kind of build the material to present as a framework, what's your research process like when you're doing that? Because that's different than finding a course to learn something new. Now you are an actual expert and you are teaching people your expertise. So what does that research process look like for you? It starts way before I even think about building a course. So I'm a big fan of starting from a service based approach if you're starting a business because you're in like the root of the issue, you're talking directly with customers, you're getting all these questions and you're seeing the pain points. And then over time, if you see pain points that are like repeated or questions that keep coming up or resources that you just can't find to give to people and you're solving it yourself, then you kind of have this thought like, hey, maybe a course would be best for this problem area. So that's kind of how I approach is that I first start by digging into what they're dealing with. And then comes the idea of the course rather than just I'm going to start a course based off this topic just because that's what I want to talk about. And then the next thing I typically do is I define the starting state of what my ideal student would be coming from. And then I define the ending state of what I'm hoping to get them to. And then I define how do I get them to slowly turn and make that state change from beginning to end point. So my courses typically look like a pyramid where I'm building a foundation and slowly guiding them to the top rather than, you know, throwing lessons at them just because that's what you're supposed to learn in that sequence. It's more guided and more intentional than that. I think it's interesting also that you are referring back to the starting places, defining a real life problem. So regardless of whether you are learning something yourself or teaching it to others, the real life problem is an important aspect of teaching and learning the kind of takeaway for me there. So I want to go back and talk about cohort based courses versus self-paced courses and how do you choose between which one as a teacher to bring to the table and when is one more appropriate than the other? I took an experimental approach. So I kind of dove in with both of them just to see what I learned as a teacher. And I've also done it from a student approach and then building on that knowledge. So when it comes to being a student, like I said, like it depends on what you're targeting. For me, if I'm looking for that network, I'm going to go the CBC route. And then if I'm looking for like actually learning the material, I'm more likely to go the recorded route. In the same way with like teaching, I kind of think about that. Like, where are my students coming from? Do they need a network or do they need the information? What do they need more? And then the final thing that I really think about is that I am a huge introvert and it takes a ton of energy for me to do a live course. So I'm very partial to doing more recorded or something like where the content is recorded, but then you have things like office hour calls and like guest speakers and just like monthly events where it enhances the content through creating a community and live events, but everything isn't live. So it's not as hard on me as an introvert. Yeah. It's not a constant scheduled process, but it gives you a way to, to also have the benefits, almost like a hybrid approach at that point. I've heard it, I've heard it called maybe the flip classroom is something that I've heard about where you, where people will watch the lesson and watch the lecture beforehand and then show up live and discuss it and have that sort of thing so you're not having to be on a podium, you were just having a nice discussion with people, which to me is sometimes easier than in your process. And I know you started when you're teaching people about remote work. It started at the remote work prep starts as a cohort based course and the first kind of iterations that I saw you creating and now it's moving more towards the async. And I'm wondering like, is the, you know, when you're doing that live, is that also part of the research process in terms of defining it and working with students and how does that work for you in terms of developing the course further? So I don't even start with the CBC. So I start one-on-one when I'm consulting with a company and I'm working with people one-on-one and, you know, companies and diving into their level. And it's not until I get that, where I feel like it's at a good level that I even start building a course. So with mastering remote leadership, which is for managers or team leads that have to lead teams remotely. I started that, like I said, one-on-one. Then I built a CBC around it. And now I'm converting that course based on feedback and based on what worked and what didn't into this hybrid model that I'm talking about. So it's kind of like an evolutionary process and I take a kind of experimental approach to everything that I go into. Like, I'm not expecting everything to work perfectly. I'm expecting to learn from this and to get better in the next iteration of it. So every time you perform this and whether it's one-on-one or a cohort-based course or the self-paced version, it's always a constant return and reevaluate and present a process to people where they have a starting state and an ending state and you're designing something. And I assume a big part of this is designing a process that actually works is an important caveat there. I think, I honestly, I think there's a lot of people out there designing, and I use the air quotes there in a way that is more like, this is how the process could be, or how I think about it in my head versus like what you were talking about where you were actually working with individuals and then groups, small groups, and then saying, Hey, this actually works so you can do it on your own, but not until you've got to the point where you feel comfortable as a, an instructor and purveyor of courses to sell it to them as such, is that, that's exactly it. Yeah. I love that. Like I'm a big, huge fan of that entire way of thinking about process in general versus a process that's a lie. And maybe that's a little harsh on people, but like a process that's a lie versus the process that actually works and is repeatable is a big difference. And I think there's a lot of, a lot of room we can move towards thinking about processes in real life. The thing I like to think about is that my number one goal is to help that evolution. So like everything else is a side thing to that. So I want something that's proven. I want something that's actionable. I want something that can work for multiple people. So like people have different learning styles and they come on with different environments and experiences, and I still want them to get just as much as this other person who has a totally different experience. That's my goal is to make it actionable and to make sure that it's something that follows them outside of the course. So even when you're in the course and you're fully, deeply ingrained in the topic, I don't want it to be like memorization where you just know what I told you. I want you to know how to think about things outside of the course once you leave it so that you can make just as good decisions then. Like helping people build their own system, basically, and transfer it to whatever their context is, because it's really difficult to define that for everybody. But how do you do that? How do you define who your course is for in the first place so that you'll know that the people coming into it are going to be successful? That goes back to what I'm doing, like working one-on-one with people. And I'm seeing like, who is this really speaking to? Who really needs this issue solved? And then I'll solve it for them specifically before I branch out to other people. How do you know for sure when somebody has been successful with a course? Oh, there's a lot of different things. So like there's metrics. So if we look at their calendar, it typically starts with like 80% meetings. And then all of a sudden, it's down to like 20% meetings per week and like that evolutionary growth there. Then it's like things like their, so for my Mastering Remote Leadership course, that would be things like their team members saying, hey, I know what I have to do. I can do it in a healthy way. I'm not having unrealistic expectations put on me anymore. Or like for my Avoiding Burnout from Remote Work course, it's more about, hey, I have a healthier approach to remote work. I'm not instantly replying to messages. I'm not, you know, feeling burnt out and constantly on that cycle all the time. And I get those comments. So I know I'm doing something right. And that's kind of how I go about it. Yeah. I wanted to ask if learner feedback affects your courses. And to me, I think the answer is probably an obvious yes, because that, and as far as I can tell, measuring that success and understanding and following up with them sounds like it's also an important part, like giving them feedback and how do you manage that long-term? How do you manage the need to like provide feedback to people, especially as you move more towards, you know, kind of the self-based paced version. And, you know, the feedback cycle is a little slower, I think, in those than in the cohort based, but how do you manage that? It's a million percent important to me. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I definitely want to know what's working and what doesn't. I definitely want to know like what can be improved, what they thought was missing, all of that. And I think the start of that is just creating an environment where people can feel like they can ask questions and they feel like they can give feedback without hurting your feelings or without, you know, coming across as rude or, you know, like I make that environment extremely open. I'm constantly asking for that. Another thing that we do is that there's a survey at the beginning of the, the course asking for where they're currently at and asking all these questions related to that. And then a survey at the end of the course, which has very similar questions to see where they're at to see like what kind of transformation was made there. So I do things like that as well. Are you at this point doing this all by yourself or have you gotten to the point where you started to bring help in? I am a solopreneur. So it's just me right now. I do use contractors for some things, sometimes for remote work prep, but not yet for my courses. Is that something that you would stick to? Cause I know it totally changes the dynamic of the work when you start having to manage or collaborate, whether you're managing or not, is that something you plan on in the future or do you prefer the kind of solo approach to this sort of stuff? It depends on the day. I feel that I like, I feel that for sure. Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, I'm going to be a solopreneur forever. This is great. And then other days I'm like, I need help. This is crazy. How am I doing everything? No, but so my background is in software engineering and product management. And while I started my company in 2018, it was just supposed to be a side project. It's something I did for fun because I was passionate about remote work and I wanted to help other people have positive remote work experiences. 2020 happened, things exploded. I still had my head of product job at a software company until summer 2021. And that's when I went full-time with remote work prep. So it's been about six to eight months-ish at this point. And after leading teams for so long, it is kind of nice to have that kind of breadth of this is about what I want to do and where I want to go and how I want to run this business. I really enjoy leading people and I really enjoy leading teams. So I doubt I'll stay away from it forever, but I first want to get my footing and make sure that the company is going in the direction that I want it to go before building it. Do you think in a way, the, as an instructor and educator, you're, you are leading and is that like your previous role as a head of product in your current role as, you know, the instructor for this course, is there overlap between those two? I think so. I think so because to me, I, so growing up, I had always thought when I'm a manager, I'm going to be in charge and this is going to be great. And then I become a manager and I'm like, whoa, it's not about being in charge. It's about being in service and service. Exactly. So you're in service to the people that you're leading, you're helping them have the environment they need to succeed. And that's the exact same thing I'm doing as an educator. I'm making sure that my students have the environment, the information, the resources, everything they need to succeed. I mean, even down to like the safe place to, for feedback and asking and like constantly, I think there's a, an incredible overlap between product development, product management and instructional design that's often overlooked because I feel like as leaders, that's really what you have to do is bring in information, do the research, share it with your team so they can reach those goals to start. They're here, they need to be there. And how do we get them there? And so in my head, there's a lot of overlap just in terms of philosophy and kind of some of the ethics of the process. I think there's also overlap in the frustration that happens when you become a manager or become an instructor. So typically like people have reached a certain point in their career as an IC, and then they just get promoted to management without any training on how to be an effective manager. And same thing for lead or for teaching people, like you reach a certain seniority and you're just expected to teach people these different things without any training on actually how to teach. So they both go through that same process of being pushed into this role without proper training on how to actually go about it effectively. Do you have a background in instructional design? Did that ever come up for you? Or is that something that you've had to research on your own? So my background is interesting. I was homeschooled starting in fifth grade and then I skipped a grade and I started taking college courses when I was 15. I ended up dropping out of college to join a startup and then was in the tech space for a while, so no formal instructional design, but I did have to learn how to teach myself and I think that influences everything I do because of that knowledge is in that I'm not just reading something and saying, okay, I'm memorizing this. I want to deeply ingrain this. I want to learn how to live by this. I want to learn how to create processes and approaches and things that work outside of when I'm specifically learning about this topic. So I think that all goes into it. Do you have any favorite frameworks or resources that you've used that along the way, just pretty much strictly in terms of instructional design, but otherwise that have kind of informed how you approach that design process? I really like starting from a question-based approach. So starting from a place of getting people to think about things on their own before you even supply them with ideas or, you know, answers just to see what do they come up with, how does this expand their mind, what do they go looking for once they have these questions that can be really good on like the student side, because it's opening their mind, it's less boring, they're interacting. And then on the teaching side, you learn so much from where they go with their answers. And one of my favorite personal frameworks, it's called understanding by design. And it was my kind of introduction into the foray of instructional design. They take that and they call them essential questions where we want to ask people questions that, that don't really have an answer. Like there's no definite, it's not a yes or no. It's something that we're going to contemplate and sparks discussion. And you really have to think deep in terms of this and then breaking those questions down into like the sub questions that you, now we need to understand that until eventually you might get down to statements, but you know, like the, that's not what's interesting. The answers and solutions, it's the discussion, right? Like the spark in them. So you have a software development background, but you have not leveraged that to build a bespoke custom course platform for yourself. Instead, you've gone with something off the shelf and I'm wondering what the trade-offs are there and where, what kind of prompted that decision? And basically if you have any tips on self-restraint, so those of us that feel like we have to build from scratch could learn from you.  Yeah. So, like I said, I am a solopreneur. I have, you know, limited time. I am running a company based off the lifestyle I want. And my lifestyle is not hustle culture. My lifestyle is not working 60 plus hours a week. It's instead making my work revolve around my life. And sometimes that means making decisions like that, where I'm not building something, even though I think it would be cool and fun and, you know, exciting. But instead I'm saying no to that and I'm taking the easy route so that I can accomplish what I actually set out to do. And what I actually set out to do is making sure that students can learn from this course. And I can't have them learn from the course if I'm spending months building out a platform. So. And you're maintaining it at that point too. So you not only build it, but now you've created a maintenance burden for yourself long-term. And the other thing is courses aren't my only thing. So like I have the fractional head of remote services. I have my content. So I have like a newsletter and then I also have courses on top of that and everything else on the side. So it's not the only thing. So it can't be me building everything from scratch. I was going to ask how you, cause you don't, you said you don't really dig into hustle culture and I appreciate that. And I'm wondering just based on my observation, I wouldn't say you do what would traditionally be in the field of marketing, but how do people find you? And what is your approach to marketing your courses and services? Yeah. I still have this reaction when I hear the word marketing. I know. That's what it's like. You don't want to say it out loud and it carries such heavy weight, but at the end of the day, we have to do it. And I think there's probably some balance of marketing that isn't the kind of a salesy kind of. Yeah. Yeah. So it's funny because I am a huge introvert and I was not very online. Before 2020 and then 2020 hit. And my, like I said, my business was there since 2018 and exploded overnight and all of a sudden I had all these incoming requests, but they required one-on-one support. And I only have so much time in the day. I couldn't keep up with them. So I started sharing online. I started sharing on Twitter because I knew no one on the platform. And so if I thought if I fail miserably, no one will know it'll be great. Of course that didn't end up happening. That's why I started there. And I started just by answering people's questions. So I would see people making statements about remote work that I felt weren't fully accurate or having questions or struggles, and I would just start chiming into the conversation. So it was literally just commenting on other people's posts. And then I hit like 1000 followers and then I started posting on my own. And now it's been like a year and a half and I'm at like 8,000 followers, which is crazy to me. I still look at the number. I'm like, that's not real. So a lot of people find me through Twitter. I'm also, I also have my own blog and my newsletter, Remotely Interesting, which has a thousand plus subscribers. I don't remember how many. I'm also part of many groups and I really take, so, so the reason why I got into this and how I was able to ease myself into it was by taking that 30 by 500 course that gave me a, yeah, exactly. That gave me a different perspective to marketing. So it wasn't about selling things to people. It was about helping people and I can get fully on board with helping people. I will help people all day. So that's kind of the approach I take to marketing. I mean, you're in good company with 30 by 500 and Amy and Alex. And when I think about marketing, my personal philosophy is very informed by what I've learned from them and their kind of mentorship over, we're almost 15 years into like me participating in what they are putting out there and it is really fantastic and kind of just a life changing way to make that word not so, because it isn't like, and that all makes sense to me because you know, when you talk about looking for pain and solving pain and helping people and this idea of service and that sort of thing, I think that's such a healthy way to approach this and I've seen it and I've seen you in action on Twitter and that's, you know, like that's where we met. And really it shines at the end of the day. I can, can see that you're putting 30 by 500 into practice. Definitely. And it's the only way that's been sustainable for me. So if I had tried to like push back on, I'm not an introvert. I'm going to go, you know, full out and just start selling people and try to do it in the car salesman kind of way, I would have lasted like a month, maybe. But now I've been in it for a couple of years online now, and I like it. I actually like going online. I like helping people, even though I'm in the public eye more, and that's less, that's outside of my comfort zone. It's still a sustainable approach that I can absolutely get on board with. Yeah. And I, I feel that, and I kind of push myself, you know, my natural inclination is to kind of be a cave dwelling nerd type and just do my thing and do work and help people when they've asked and do that sort of thing. But, you know, like being out there and doing this thing and talking to people is also very rewarding too. So it's been a nice transition. What's your long-term goal in terms of, product empire really isn't the right word, but what's your long-term goal in terms of building and sustaining your business that you've started? My business has been sustainable from day one. We've always been profitable. That's just been incredibly important to me. I'm also bootstrapped and I plan on staying that way, at least for now. I took a very, very long approach to switching over to my company full time because I wanted that financial freedom. So I had, you know, this tech exec job, very comfortable. It was very rewarding as well. Like I liked my team members and all of that. So it felt like a difficult decision to give that up because honestly, I go, I grew up in a very poor background. That job that I had was like my dream life. And to say no to that for something that I was building, that wasn't a for sure thing, seemed like the craziest thing in the entire world. So it took me a long time. So first I started with like a four day work week at my job so that I would have extra time for my side company. Then over the summer when I had to teach the CBC, I did a two month entrepreneurial leave from my full-time job. And then when I was supposed to come back, that's when I officially quit and I converted my employer to be a client. So I didn't do the approach that a lot of people do where they just quit and they just have faith, like I'll figure it out. I was definitely like, I am very risk averse. How do I go about this in a way that creates kind of psychological safety and healthiness around what I'm doing? And my income from my company exceeded what I was making in the tech exec job by the time I quit. So it was more than healthy. I plan on, my goal this year is to switch. So last year, 80% of my revenue came from services and 20% from products. I want to flip those percentages this year. So I'd love it to be 80% products and 20% services. That's hard because I do a lot of services. But I do have six product launches planned for this year, including the one I just released on the avoiding burnout from remote work mini course. So yeah, I'm working hard at it. So this, I'm just curious if you, the 30 by 500 process. And when you took that course, which is one of my favorites online. Was that before you quit? Did you take that before? Oh yes, I took that in February, 2020. So right before my business went insane. Wow. That, that is really fantastic. And I'd love to meet another kind of, kind of nerd of a feather, maybe. Just somebody that's doing this and doing it in a way that I really love to see. Marissa, thank you so much for taking time out of your day and chatting with me. I really appreciate it. Of course. Yes. Thank you so much for having me. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey Mark. Hi Joel. I'm really interested to talk to you because one, I think you approach teaching a little differently than I do. And you also are kind of in a different subject area than I'm usually used to. Cause we kind of do the front-ended egghead and that's like, that's where I live is kind of in that vicinity and that's been my career, so I'm really kind of, kind of stoked to, to learn more about your process and what you. Do to approach the subject matter that you teach. The first thing I wanted to kick off with though, is how do you personally approach a new complex subject? When you sit down to learn something new, what's your strategy when you're learning? Yeah, I have a pretty flushed out process at this point. My first step is I really just want to find out as much as I can about. The specific topic that I want to teach. So it's, I call it like the fun step where I'm just learning as much as I can. I'm trying to find information on blogs or documentation, and I'm just getting as much info as I can and I'm dumping it back out into my own kind of subject matter material where I can then reference when I am creating the material. So this helps kind of get familiar with the topic if you're, if I'm not familiar with it at all, or I just, I can kind of deep dive into the topic without worrying too much about what I'm going to teach you. Do you approach, okay. So if you're not going to teach it, right. Like if you're learning something or is it the same for you? Like, right. Like if you're going to sit down and just learn something for yourself or learn some sort of technology that you want to use personally, or do you, when you sit down to, to learn something, do you have that, I'm going to teach this mindset in your head? I pretty much know the topic I'm going to teach before I get started. But when I'm learning, if I'm learning something on my, for my own skills, it seems like I tried to get things working quicker and like real implementation. But when I'm creating the course, I just want to deep dive and more so read about everything and get all the, get all the info together first before creating something, which is interesting. It's kind of, so when you're building for you, it's like for yourself, you'll get in there and rough it out or build something and kind of get your hands dirty and approach it that way. Versus trying to get all the information and as much background as possible, because you plan on teaching this and that backgrounds more necessary when you're teaching a topic. Yeah. And it gets, I think it gives you a more general sense of everything that you're going to learn as well, rather than just maybe siloed into a specific thing that you're just trying to get working. Yeah. Trying to get it done. When you think about what makes a good course, what does that look like to you? What are the components of a good online course? Components of a course, I try to establish what the transformation of the course is going to be upfront. So defining that, who the course is for, almost like a persona. So once I have that, then I can focus on, I try to just make a transition for the person that's taking the course. So I think a good course just gets, it takes a really complex topic or complex subject and just breaks it down into really simple lessons. That's why I was attracted to egghead long time ago, where you have these small bite-sized lessons, right? And they're just very easy to learn. Cause you're not kind of scattered and trying to teach five things at once. You're just trying to teach one little concept at a time. It's just much easier to get across. When somebody first interacts with your courses in general, what's the, what are they trying to achieve? Have you noticed any particular pattern in either in their professional or their personal lives? Like why are people, you know, skilling up in the subjects that you teach? I work pretty strictly in Magento topic, which is an e-commerce framework that's currently managed by Adobe. And it's an extremely hard platform to learn. You can think of, I remember back in the day, trying to learn like sugar CRM. That was another PHP base, just extremely complex content management system. And Magento is kind of similar to that, where there's just so much to learn. So the courses, it's a hard subject to teach because of that too, because there's just so many topics. So mostly I see just everyone trying to learn the fundamentals and become efficient and productive at something. It's, and there's different topics. So maybe someone wants to learn specifically how to theme something. So that's, you know, that's a whole topic in itself and their end goal is to be able to create something for a client and just know what they're doing without guessing and copying pasting things from Stack Overflow. So yeah, just more so understanding the topic. To what extent is it important to understand those goals, what they're trying to achieve when you sit down to design a new course or teach something? Well, I, they pretty much want an entire course on the entire subject as much as possible. So it's, it comes down to fleshing out all that material and just having all of those little nuances or tricks. And I have a lot of people that also want to learn how things are done, not or why things are done, not how they're done. So there's a lot of that explaining why you do things a certain way, as opposed to some other way. Is there a difference like in your approach when you teach somebody the why versus how, like how does that differ in terms of maybe how you design or how you approach the teaching process? Yeah, it's very different. So when you're trying to teach how to do something, it's more like a reference course of here's how to do this, here's how to do that. And there's not too much, there's not too much explanation going on within the lessons of the course. It's, they tend to be shorter and straight to the point. And that's how a lot of courses are. But when you start teaching the why, it's much harder to dig into the code and cause you have to understand it first yourself of why things are done. And that's sometimes the hardest part where you have to learn it better than, you know, you've known it before. So to teach something, it's, it's really different from, from learning it on your own because you have to explain it, be able to explain things. Do you have a, like a instructional design framework or philosophy that you use, or is this something that you've kind of developed over time just through practice? Yeah, I just created it myself. I've noticed it align with some other processes that are out there though, that are really similar and, you know, there's books on how to get things done or how to focus on something. And they seem to kind of correlate with the steps that I take to create a course. So that learning, that learning document and dump out is sort of the step one. And then I get into actually coding up like a working demo. Then I move on to defining, Hey, what's this course gonna, what's it going to be named? What's a general outline of the course. And then I focus into kind of taking that demo code that I really didn't, it's not supposed to be an end product. And I work it into actually creating more of a formalized, this is what we will be creating in the course. And then I kind of refine that, that demo material and organize how to build things and in what order. I think the order that you teach things is so important, especially with a complex topic. And then I get into just outlining the actual lessons and the kind of the final curriculum. And the easiest part is the recording and the editing, I think. So after I kind of get everything transformed to outlines and all of the content sort of established of what I'm going to teach, the recording kind of takes care of itself. Is that, I mean, it feels to me like that's because you've done a lot of research and you're comfortable and understand because of the foundations that you've kind of built for yourself. Yes. So these steps, yeah. So the steps kind of overlay on each other and to code up a working demo is something you have to be familiar with the material and kind of, that's kind of what you learn in that document and dump stage. And then same thing with converting an outline into lessons. Well, once you've code coded a demo and then perhaps refined it into a working version, you're already familiar with that. So yeah, it definitely, this framework definitely makes things easier. And I noticed after a few, about three courses, I need some kind of process to create something. Cause I didn't have anything when I started and I just needed a repeatable process to make sure I can deliver these on time and of high value. One of my jokes I like is if you're not using a framework, you're inventing. And if you keep inventing a framework over and over again, instead of even developing your own, like that's where the demons lie for me. Right? Like, it's like there has to be some sort of process. It doesn't have to be super rigid, but some sort of process to get like consistent and just repeatable results over time. Yeah. And yeah, I noticed when I deviate from this process to it, it seems to linger off or not, things don't get done quite as efficiently because you're kind of lost in that process of how to create a final working version of that course. I'm curious when you're thinking about the example space and I think it's really important, right? Like it's important what you are teaching because it needs to be relevant and how do you balance kind of the messy, repetitive, you know, frustrating hair pulling real world, right? Like of software development with the example space and kind of basically the lab sanitized version of that. How do you balance those for your learners? It's very hard. So I have pretty much foundational fundamental courses that I've been working on. So but I'm kind of at the point where I have a lot of the foundational and fundamental things done. And now I think it would make sense to break off of that and create courses that are purely building a certain module. Now you're using all of the concepts that you learned in the fundamentals and foundation courses and you don't have to worry about explaining all of those topics in detail because they're explained in that other course. So I think focusing on those real life examples is important because that's what everyone wants to know at the end of the day. But you can't learn that without the fundamentals first. So, yeah, do you see a lot of people coming in there wanting to solve something specific or they have got a new gig and are overwhelmed or how does that all the time? Yeah. And a lot of times I can't even answer it because I don't know the answer. It's just things take a lot of time and research. Yeah. So people want to skip past the fundamentals and get right to the gravy bits. Oh, yeah. You know, like, like, oh, I just wish I could inject those fundamentals and be done with it. But it doesn't work like that, right? Like, yeah, Adobe has their Adobe commerce certifications. And I don't know how many times I've heard from so many people. They want to get certified and they don't know the fundamentals or they're just they just heard of Magento a few weeks ago. It's like, well, it'll take about six months to a year to get certified and get alert, start off with the fundamentals and work your way through it. And then, you know, I usually don't hear anything back after. But it's definitely people want to skip steps. And you feel like you're competing with the official documentation, their learning resources for the platform, or how does that work out for you when you are going against a juggernaut like Adobe? Are they not focused on it the same way? I'm I don't really see it as competing because my content is so different from theirs. They have their subscription that's very expensive. So there's that that huge price gap for one. And of course, they're known, though. So that's one of the hardest problems is just getting known and getting your name out there. But yeah, I sort of do things my own way. So in a way, I don't really feel like I'm competing. I don't feel like anyone can really compete with me of how I'm exactly creating these courses. They might create their own Magento courses, but that's completely different in their way of teaching things. So, yeah, it's I have my own niche for sure. It sounds like there's plenty of room in the space. Yeah, it's a big market, even though it's been around for a while and there's actually not too many individual course graders on this topic. So there's definitely a huge space. Yeah. And of course, the whole price component of Adobe subscription versus your own pricing. So how do you pick an example? Like when you what is how do you come up with what to teach in terms of the pure example space? I was taking kind of random suggestions from people and then going and building that. But that's a really good question, because it's so hard to determine what to build next, because I want to at this point, I want to affect as many subscribers as I can. I pretty much work off of subscriptions. So learning all of those fundamental courses in a specific order is very important. Yeah, I've done random topics and they've just bombed. But I've done topics that it's funny, I've surveyed people on and social media and everything and topics that they didn't want at all on social media. I wound up doing very well as sold courses because that's just what real people that are subscribing and learning want. Yeah, I think there's some danger in surveying and kind of getting the voice like that voice. Right. Like versus like people often say one thing, but actually want or need something totally different. Right. Like, oh, that sounds really fun. I want to do that. But fun isn't necessarily what you need. Right. Like what you need is to get in there and shoulder in and plow the field. Yeah, I've done I've asked those same questions to my paid subscribers. It's funny. And the answers are completely different of what you what they want next. So it's it's kind of funny. Yeah. And I think that's interesting, too, like the just free, you know, like people in the free wild versus paying customers and kind of what their opinions will be, how they'll treat the product, you know, like when you give away something like if you do a workshop and it's free, then you're doing a webinar versus if you charge and then people actually show up and they're engaged, right? Like that kind of balance between like who you're listening to and who you're catering to. And generally speaking, the paying customers, the winner there in my book, I thought you you mentioned that you are running on subscriptions, but then you also offer a la carte pricing so you can go in and purchase courses individually or you can purchase a subscription or you can purchase a lifetime pass. And I'm wondering, like what went into your thought process for coming? Like, how am I going to sell this and how am I going to price it and how am I going to divvy this up and offer people? And what is the it sounded like the subscriptions are the revenue driver, but what ended up being the winner? Yeah, they both do well. Even the individual subscriptions have been even picking up lately. It's funny. But so I started off just with one course was Magento Fundamentals course. And it's I have one course, so there's no reason for a subscription. Things went pretty well, sold really well and started getting asked about the front end of Magento JavaScript layer. So I created a course on that. And it's funny, as soon as I released that second course, I already had users asking me for a subscription that they can subscribe because if I planned on creating more courses and after that third course, I actually launched a subscription already. And I was I didn't think anyone would subscribe because I only have three courses, but it actually kind of picked off and it's it hasn't stopped since. So kind of just listen to customer as far as what to charge for the individual courses. I sort of picked it off in there. I just had to start with something and I definitely focus on premium courses at the moment. And I wanted something different from Udemy. That's 10, you know, 80 hour course. And so I did something that it's 999 this week, Mark. What was that? That Udemy course is 999 this week. Yeah, exactly. And I can't control that. Yeah. They're going to randomly mark it down 90 percent. So definitely focus on the premium side. And after a ton of research from I use Teachable and they have a lot of great blog articles of how to price your course and value pricing. And I definitely value price all my courses and my offerings. Probably not enough even. But yeah, it's pricing's always been difficult. But I think the market, like the programming course market, is grossly undercharging just for the like the value, right? Like what you can get if you learn these skills and, you know, the developer salaries and where it can take you in a very short amount of time if you shouldering and do the work. And people are, you know, it's like they're charging two, three hundred dollars for, you know, a very full featured course. And I'm like, I don't know, like I feel like that's an order of magnitude too low. And then I'm wondering what what is like an eight thousand dollar programming course look like, right? Like if you take it an order of magnitude above that or, you know, like a multiplier up. And what do you have to do to produce something like that is an interesting question. What do you think? What would it take to to have something at even a higher level, right? Like another multiplier up? Yeah, I'd love to sell an eight thousand dollar course. Yeah. What does that look like? What does that look like for a programming course? I've actually talked to a course, kind of a course coach at Session. That was one of their suggestions was you don't have a high ticket item. I do sell my my subscription as a lifetime one time payment. That's a multiple subscription. But it's still apparently I'm still missing a high ticket item. And right now at the moment, that plays into more cohort based courses. It's hands on, right? And like it's you and your time or you or your whoever that is, right? Like it's you and then some sort of person. Yeah. And it's yeah. And it's interesting. I've been constantly thinking about it and I'm very protective of my time, though. So that's what's why I haven't done it yet. I'm still trying to work out how that would look and work. If that would be viable. Right now, I'm completely autonomous with my time. I can take weeks off. Everything still runs itself. So once you have that cohort based course, even if it's just, you know, two to four weeks, it's still a commitment. You have to show up like you can't. You know, they paid you and basically have a contract at that point. So you well, and then you I mean, you're teaching them and you just have to show up. Right. That's part of the deal. And that's the hard part. I think it's interesting. You know, you're a developer. And one of the inclinations for developers is to start from scratch and well develop. Right. Like when people say, hey, what does it take to be a developer? And it's like, well, you develop software. That's pretty much what it takes. And I think it's interesting that, you know, like you stopped short of the delivery platform, right? Like you said, you're using teachable. And I'm wondering, you know, what was that a debate in your head? Did you think about building your own thing or was it like straight to like what's the best decision for me right now to deliver? It's funny because I do have that developer mindset. I want to build everything. But I think over the years, I sort of slowly trained myself in the like fit gap analysis because we did it for clients with Magento sites where, hey, what's the build versus buy? And there's a module out there that does this. And if it does it, 90 percent should absolutely just buy it because it's not worth the time. So when it came time to selling my first course, I actually didn't even think about creating my own platform. I've seen people that have built their own platforms. And then at least initially, all of their work is on supporting that course platform rather than delivering the material and the content that is really why they're doing it. So it's yeah, I figured at some point I'll eventually probably build my own if something else just doesn't come up and present itself. But yeah, it's more of like, do I want to deliver content, course content to my subscribers or am I focused on building this course platform? And that build versus bad mentality is very, very important to me. And is it worth it? And it has to be really worth it for me to conduct something like that. What do you think you might be missing out on by using Teachable? Right now, Teachable's great. Provide me for a living as a living. So can't complain much about that. But the almost a lot of my a lot of big portion of my business is subscriptions. And there's subscriptions definitely lack where a user can't go and downgrade their account to another platform. They can for my teams. They can automatically go ahead and subscribe multiple members and then assign it themselves and manage all those users. Yeah, there's upgrading, downgrading accounts, prorating the account. So when someone let's say they only want to go another three months, they can't like automatically cancel for three months or something like that. And credits to subscriptions with. You're triggering me a little bit because I do build a platform and all of this stuff is stuff that I've like consciously actually built and like think about. And then and it's funny because I look at other platforms and what they lack and then like the things that I've like, like bit my nails over the years and made sure that they were just right and implemented. And then, yeah, I don't know. Like it's always a balance, right? Like when you're developing. But I don't know. It's interesting to me. That's a big balance. And something I forgot about just remember now is like that and taxes or is becoming very important. I'm coming from an e-commerce space and I've seen tons of businesses get completely fined and attacked from the tax purpose that they weren't taxing and submitting and remaining properly. So that's a big that's a very important part of me. And Teachable does take care of all of that for me. If I was all based in the U.S. and selling U.S. customers, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But big international following, it's if submit to multiple countries, it's. Have you seen somebody, a U.S. citizen in the U.S. based business actually receive fines from a European entity and then have that enforced and actually have to pay them? I haven't. And that's the argument. Yeah, it's yeah. And it's I know a lot of business people and I hear people talk about that a lot and worried about European regulations. And if I was if I lived in the U.K. or Germany, that's exactly what I would do. I wouldn't. Yeah, if I was there, I'd be like, well, the U.S. doesn't exist. And here I'm like, well, yeah, I think at the very least. I'm in the U.S., so I need to charge sales tax to U.S. customers for sure. But there's even loopholes around that with live elements. And it gets really interesting, especially even with VAT tax. One thing I've noticed about in my experience is it's strictly in the U.S. and with dealing with U.S. states is they're very quick to send you a letter when you owe them money. They are very quick. The federal government and state governments and even local governments, if you owe them money and you are required to pay them, they let you know, like like across the board. They let you know, hey, you live here and they'll overestimate what you owe them to. So it's like, oh, hold on. I don't know you that much. Let's actually do the math here and figure that out. It's a real chore. Like it's one of my least favorite things. And I think about sometimes this idea, if I had to globally handle paperwork, I would literally just get a job. Yeah, yeah. No, thanks. Like, I'm out. I can't do it. No, that's what I was always worried. You know, I depend on this for my livelihood, too. And if they ever if I ever got attacked from a European enemy, you owe me, you know, twenty thousand dollars and it happened multiple times or just something random. It would it could take me out. So well, and I mean, I just don't think it's realistic, right? Like like this idea of like if the U.S. was going into different countries and saying you owe us money, like it just doesn't. It would, you know, globalism exists. But, you know, like if all the hundreds of countries on the planet were all trying to like get at each other citizens to pay and follow their regulations, it would just be like this utter chaos and nobody would be able to do business whatsoever. I get it. Like if, you know, like Amazon and Google, like but they have entities, they have literal offices and divisions in these countries and they have to comply. I don't know what's the whole. And even with that, there is actually footnotes in there that I don't think anyone reads that if they don't pay that on something or someone isn't charging them, they're supposed to self-pay that. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. I have never gotten a sales bill or anything is teachable does that for me. So it's yeah, that is a nice thing with the platform. And I don't know, like Stripe is doing that. And there's other services that I don't particularly care for. So I'll mention them. That'll just completely take care of that across the board, too. So there's a lot of help out there for doing these things is advancing that as well. I have a feeling they're going to build that in tax remittance very soon. Yeah, it's a competitive feature. I think people want to do it. So they're going to build it in. What's your do you have like as a course producer and a teacher and a developer, do you have any sort of audacious goals or big plans that you're working on? Not yet. At this point, it's just making as much content as I can. That's been the number one. I have six premium courses. So on a subscription, it's tough to get people to resubscribe. It could be at points. So definitely creating as much content as I can is my number one priority right now. Do you fold any sort of community aspect into it? I have. I use actually Circle as a pretty good integration with Teachable, with Auth integration. So I use it's pretty new, but it's been working out great. They have Webhooks, full API, so I can when someone purchases a course, I can tag them and do all sorts of cool things in Circle. But yeah, it's been working out really well. Nice. Love it. Well, Mark, it's great talking to you. I appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. I look forward to seeing your continued success and setting a kind of a good example for course producers, both in quality, but then also charging based on the value of your work and what you're delivering to people. I really respect that you've upped that a little bit, I feel. And I like to see that and I want to see more of that. So I appreciate it. Thanks, Joel. Cheers. Thanks. Great to be here. It was nice chatting with you.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm pretty excited to talk to you today because I think we both have a strong mutual passion for teaching people and helping people and, you know, like elevating others through our experience. And we do that through, you know, like online teaching and writing articles and all that fun stuff. I want to kind of kick it off and ask you, when you sit down to learn something, like what's your personal learning style, like how do you think about new difficult problems or subjects or areas of knowledge that you want to dive into and go about learning? Yeah, that's a great question. You know, it might surprise people because of video courses, but I do a lot of reading and I do, you know, not just a lot of reading, but I have folders and folders on my machine full of like really silly little things. For example, I'm learning Rust right now and I already have a dozen tiny, super tiny, like little Rust apps that for me to learn or, you know, I spin up code sandboxes left and right. I spin up JS bins still because sometimes it's just the fastest way to do some JavaScript, you know? So yeah, that's me. I read a lot and then I try little things. I really encourage people, just try it. Like you don't know how some expression or syntax or something works, try it and find out. There's no harm in it. Let it break a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting to me and I don't know if you've kind of noticed this, but I hear it a lot and people obviously love video learning, but I, and just in having these conversations with people that create courses, there's kind of a strong opinion that text and written content is maybe a preference. And I'm wondering, have you noticed that in terms of people consuming your own content or just generally, or do you think, you know, what's the balance of those two kind of modes of learning? I kind of feel like both should augment each other. For example, you know, I watch a lot of stuff that isn't tech. Like I watched a lot of woodworking videos and let me tell you, I'd much rather watch them than sit down and read it. So to some degree it's, what are you learning? But also there's other things. When I'm reading tech, because so much of it has to be like code samples, I do at least want to see them in a place that is like static. So I can look at this, I can study it. Maybe I can play with it. I really feel like they can benefit each other. When I write blog posts, you know, I can dive into things in written words sometimes that are more difficult to explain with a video, or, you know, it might just be boring. Like I am talking to you in a video. You'd rather just read that at your speed versus I'm showing you in a video. You know, Egghead's all about show, you know, don't talk at the user, you know, keep showing them what you're doing. So I just kind of feel like, you know, really good content probably has a mix of both. And honestly, me moving forward, everything I'm trying to do is both. And I'm not trying to do a one-to-one thing. The thing I write isn't just a transcript. It's like, the thing I write is the written way I would explain this concept. The video I make is the visual way I would explain this concept. It's a different medium. It's not just like taking a transcript from a video doesn't replace the like writing the article or the lesson in a written format. Yeah, I agree with that for sure. When did you like, you've been doing this for a while now. Is making courses and teaching and taking that from kind of more of an ad hoc, almost hobby level of instructing into making more refined courses, has that had any impact on your life or career? Yeah. You know, when you go to make content, it's okay maybe not to know everything, but in the process of making it, you're going to learn so much about the topic you're trying to share. You thought you knew it, you don't know it, like until you try and teach it, even then you don't know it. Teaching refines understanding. It's worthwhile to pursue trying to even just share information because you'll gain a more solid understanding. I think other things are like, let's be honest, it's made my network a wonderful network. I've gotten to meet really cool people. I've gotten to know a lot more people and just the idea that people reach out to me every once in a while and they're like, dude, I took this, you know, honestly, I think my linked list lesson, that one lesson I think has made half the money just because so many people have to learn how to do a linked list for dumb interview, you know? And so, you know, not to thank a poor interview question for my success, but to some degree I get so many people reach out and be like, I didn't know shit about this until I took this course. I didn't know shit about it until I made the course. So you're welcome, bro. I've had to implement a linked list on the job once and for like a purpose, it was the perfect data structure for, which made me pretty happy actually to like actually need something like that in a practical sense, like I'm graphing it out and I'm like, wait, this is a linked list. There you go. I've only used it once too. So it's like synthesizing it from scratch a little bit, but then, you know, the pattern forms and you all of a sudden you're using something that you know. If I can go on this a little bit, that's the thing that drives me. I really like to think about patterns. I like to think about underlying concepts. And so when I'm trying to teach something, I want the people who are learning from me to be able to walk away with like, maybe it's a linked list is the implementation, but the idea is like this node connects to this node connects to this node. And if I ever have something in my work life where that's happening, I recognize the pattern and then apply the data. Like I don't want them to just go off with, I happen to know X, Y, Z about this thing. I would assume. And it's funny because you talked about woodworking and I've done a little bit of that and learned and kind of did it through the visual demonstration way and seeing plans and even taking classes. And to me, like it's just this idea of anything that we want to know. It's the idea of a pattern, spotting the pattern and seeing it in one context and learning it, but then being able to take that pattern and apply it in new context. And that's really the trick, right? When you were able to take it from following instructions, step-by-step into, you know, like something where you build it on your own or solve a problem on the job where the variables are different, but you're like, wait, this is the same pattern. And you're able to apply that. And I've never been able to achieve that with woodworking, but I definitely have been able to achieve it in my coding life and see it over and over again. It's probably true for gosh, almost, almost most things at the end of the day, when you're really trying to learn like complex subjects, right? Like that's the, that's where it's at. I totally agree. That's exactly what I'm trying to get at. I don't really enjoy making content that I call like duct tape content and it's perfectly fine. It needs to be out there, especially in the dev rel space. And by that, let's build X app by duct taping W Y Z or whatever, these three things together. And I don't enjoy making that content as much because to me, those variables are interchangeable. I'd much rather talk about how did we put these together? What was the patterns we used to do this? So then, you know, tomorrow, if you want to refactor something to use, say, let's say it's a react app and you're using one state management, truthfully, like if you follow good patterns, you can probably replace the whole thing with something else. And I'd rather you have the confidence to be able to do that, to be able to follow the pattern, not just what were the docs that this library had me stitched together and stuff like that. I think it's been a pretty strong preference just in the world is like sorting by new means the best things are going to be at the top when you're like the newest thing is the current best thing. And just my practical experience is that isn't always the case, right? Like you can, if you go back to thought or philosophy or computer science or anything, there's this, these patterns that people have discovered over the years. And you know, if you're ignoring those or we're constantly renaming those, it makes it really a struggle for learners because it's vocabulary is already a struggle. Now you're dealing with this, you know, like renaming for, for all sorts of various purposes. Some of them commercial, some of them, you know, just mistakes, right? Like we just rediscover things. Yeah. I agree. I agree. That kind of relates to, I was wondering, how do you decide what to teach? Like when you're, you know, like you're sitting down and you're like, I'm going to make a course. Is it like the something, is it like a Eureka moment or is that something that's intentionally, you know, do you seek out what to teach? You know, I, gosh, I'm probably not the best at this. I think there are people who are more pragmatic and, and more rigorous in coming up with, a lot of it is just like what intrigues me enough to put in the time because making courses takes me quite a bit more time than I think people expect. It's work. Yeah. And I don't think that, I don't think it's just, Oh, a video editing takes a lot. It's even my process is just long. If you don't mind, I'll explain a little bit. Yeah. Let me hear it. So my state machine course for egghead is a really great example. I made a course that has, I don't know, 20 something lessons and I did a workshop and we had probably, I think it was four or five weeks to do it because we were getting it done for the holiday. If I remember the holiday promo and I shit you not, man, I probably put 200 hours into it. Like I was getting up early. I was going to bed late. And the reason I put in so much is because the way I build up my knowledge base for something like that is I literally rewrote the docs, like in my own notes, basically. Like I just kept reading them and rewriting them. And I was like, Oh, in fact, I made six contributions to the docs because I ended up finding, Oh, this doesn't match up. This doesn't make sense. But I needed to build up that knowledge base to feel confident about something I was already interested in, but like I thought I knew, but I didn't, you know, to some degree. And so half the time was that, and then the other half is just, you know, with my ADHD, sometimes I really, I just don't make great incremental progress. So things take me a lot of time. And so having that interest in something, it's a really big deal for me. If I'm not interested, even though it's practical, like I'll never do it. Like I just won't get it done. And so I think that's why my courses have looked quite a bit different than other people's courses. You know, I think, I think to me, it really is interest driven. You mentioned that you did work, the workshop and approached it that way. Is that something you're typically going to think about? Or I know that at the time, like, I think we were asking people to do that sort of thing. But just what is your, you know, outside of that, if you're going to sit down and you're thinking about the reduced course or async await and just asynchronous JavaScript in general, what are you doing to design and prepare for that? Yeah. Kind of the asynchronous way, right? That's an idea in your head. You know, you're obviously thinking about it and you know, like you're in the stream of thought, but you know, like what other kind of processes do you employ? That's great. That's a great question. Cause cause I don't think people realize some of these ideas sit in my head for like years and they're just like churning. But in terms of actual like work that's documented progress, I've been starting to write obsidian notebooks or or whatever you would call them about the topics. I have this idea and I don't, I feel I've been sharing this in private, but I might try this. I'm just not sure it's worth it, but I'm thinking about releasing or selling my obsidian notebooks on a topic as like additional material or as part of the material. I have this belief that there's value in learning graphically, not just linearly, but it's unproven to some degree, or at least I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time. You mean like a network graph, like a neural, not a neural network. That's probably overloaded, but versus just the network versus a straight line where like a book is a straight line and the entire curriculum for your college degree is a graph. Yeah. I just have this feeling like if I were to hand someone a graph, a second brain of my react knowledge, I could make a linear path through it and I will, but I would love the idea of having, being able to connect to all the concepts and then giving you the opportunity to just have access and to explore. Because I think part of learning is exploring, like you really want to solidify a concept. You can't just go watch my video or take some exercise. You have to explore this or that, try building this or that. It doesn't have to be big. It just has to be big enough to connect the nodes of ideas in your brain. And I'm writing those to some degree. Those are sporadic. I'm not the best note taker. I never have been. So it's a bit of a pipe dream, but it's something I'm thinking about doing. But then I'll start to write some articles. I'll start to, I have a whiteboard up here. I'll start to break down what are ideas I want to hit. And frankly, like half my ideas probably don't make it. You know, it's just, I have never been afraid to just have an idea, have it, explore it. Maybe it goes nowhere. And yeah, I just kind of sit there and there just comes this inflection point for better or worse where it's okay. I feel comfortable enough to know the direction I'm going, where I'm starting. Maybe I write a script or two and I just, you know, get started. Once I get moving, once I get some videos recorded or a blog post written on it or whatever, then I can really sit down and start to break down the tasks. And I'll do like the state machine course, for example, I had a Trello board because it's nothing special. It was just a few columns, but it was like, here's all the videos I got to do. Here's all the writing I got to do. Knock them out. The to-do list at the end of the day, but in a nicer format, I think Trello boards like Kanban and swim lanes in general are just a useful way to visualize, right? Get some of that dopamine of knocking it off, you know? I think one of the interesting things, and I actually like fully agree with you on this idea that we are working in nodes on a graph and then the connections, like why is this connected? The connection between the nodes is really like a often overlooked bit of metadata. Why should I go over here? And you're absolutely right. You can carve a path through it and you can carve a straight line through a graph. And we have to do that at some point, like you have to, you know, even just connecting two nodes is making a line, right? So now you have that. Why are these connected? Why are you moving on to this? And why is this the next step? It's really an interesting concept to me. And then also this ability to, you know, for everybody's circumstance, they might want to like veer over here and it's like completing a course isn't the goal for most people. I don't think many people sit down and wake up in the morning and think, you know what? I'm going to take a course today and I'm going to get finished. We can sit down and kind of think about general ideas that, you know, people probably want to get a nice six figure job as a web developer and, you know, more of that, please. But, you know, what else is going on in their lives or what goals are they trying to achieve is always an interesting challenge of navigating people through the graph because everybody wants a trail to like, that's important. But how do you balance that prescriptive with the freedom of choice that we're all presented with on it? It's true. I think that might be informed by where you are in your career and like how you learn or what you want to learn. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. So when typically a course is going to have examples where you're demonstrating something and then exercises, and I was wondering how do you design examples for your lesson? Like when you want to sit down and be like, what should I like demonstrate to build? Because that's part of that choice we're making, right? That's part of that structure and it's kind of important. And you almost never get it right. And right's maybe not the right word. I just, man, I've said this on Twitter. I probably shouldn't say here, but you're never going to make everyone happy with your examples. If you do like you're probably making something so watered down that it's not useful to be honest. But even then they'll complain because it isn't useful. Some people are very good at it. I honestly feel like my examples are weak, but that could be more like I view myself that way, not how the world views me. And I'm willing to admit that, but it depends on the thing. For example, this Reduce course, I made examples the exact way I decided to really learn Reduce. I decided one day as a joke to sit down and redo all the array methods with just Reduce. And I got through 20 of them. There's a boatload of them. I got through a lot of them. And I, so those examples to me, that's how I did it. That, that just was just, that's how I learned. So you get to, you know, how I learned to ride a bike, you learn to ride a bike. But other ones like, so my state machines course, this was kind of fun. Like I didn't want to do it UI focused. Someone else was already making at the time a state machine and react course during that same window of time, if you remember. And I just looked around my house and I looked for things that are state machines, like a light switch. I'm pointing to one in my room right now for those listening or the space heater. Literally I did three or four lessons. I think there was some, if I remember right, they're about like parallel machines and maybe hierarchical machines and stuff. And my space heater literally has both of those. And I just took things in my life and put them in there. And then other ones are like, I'm working on some material for a potential react course. I don't want to promise anything. I don't want to make things promised, but you know, I think it's okay to just make the simple thing. I'm making a note taking app. Why? Because it covers all the concepts. Like I don't, it doesn't need to be esoteric to be useful. Well, and domain is, cause I'm actually a huge fan of the to-do list when it comes to web development, just because you don't have to explain it to anybody. Everybody knows what a to-do list is and share. We're sick of that example, but also most apps that I've built at some point devolved out into just being a to-do list anyway, or, you know, it's like CRUD forms and lists, and that's so much of development. And that's not necessarily the most interesting side of development, but it's like a very practical and, you know, often true element of what the actual job is. Exactly. I think I'm with you. Uh, the whole point of the to-do list isn't to do an interesting to-do list. It's to make something so mundane that you actually can observe and see what's neat about, say, this framework or this language or this statement. Like, the whole point is that the details are mundane, right? Don't complain about the example cause that's not the real point of what you're doing. The real point is to give you exposure to whatever this new concept or topic is through the lens of something familiar. So when somebody's coming, how do you, when you're thinking about and designing a course or putting together your course material, how do you balance this need for prerequisite knowledge and the assumptions of what they'll actually know coming into the experience? Sure. I probably side a little too far on the, I'll give you all the foundation kind of stuff. It's not, it's not, I taught people JavaScript to do any of my courses. That happens to be the language I know best in, in writing. But there are things where I'll take a moment and explain what is just a language feature. But I feel like sometimes it's just worthwhile to beat and be like, okay, Hey, let me break this down for you. Or, you know, I did a workshop on hooks and you know, I take a beat to be like, this is a closure just so we're all on the same page before we go forward. The hardest part about doing that is you'll always run into people who are like, I know that Kyle, I'm like, good for you. There are some people who don't. And you stay calm for two minutes while I finish, you know, you know, there's always people like that. The truth is when you teach, you just have to accept the fact that you won't meet everyone at the exact right place. So in my case, I probably lean a little more towards explaining concepts. Maybe I don't have to to most people, but I'd rather do it to be safe than to leave people confused later on down the road. Yeah, that makes sense. When you set out and you've built a course delivery platform to present your courses on, what was your approach for building that? What were the options available to you? And ultimately, what did you decide in terms of kind of broad strokes? Not necessarily. Not details. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, like we're, this isn't, we're not chatting about the programming details, but I'm curious about the, like the thought process and that went into the actual construction of it. Cause we have so many options really like at the end of the day. I want to, I want to speak about it from a, like a philosophical point really quick. I do not feel naturally inclined to be a good, like entrepreneur to build businesses. It's not really where my interests are, what I think about, but I recognized having that, it's almost a superpower. Having that ability could be useful in my life. And so building a platform for myself was partly a way to experiment and pursuing building a business and being an entrepreneur in a low risk way. At the end of the day, my courses aren't going to get me sued. Like I'm not writing stuff that's going to cause security issues or something someday. And so this is a low risk way for me to practice being an entrepreneur to see one, can I do it? What lessons can I learn? So to me, just building the platform was a lesson in, in that. So the way I chose to go about it was as I do with most things, I started with a tweet, as stupid as that sounds, but I made a tweet of, you know, I saw some people who needed to learn reduce. I had this crazy idea that I would just take my blog, which really informed why and how I want to write courses. So my blog is a Gatsby blog with MDX. It just happens to be Gatsby. I don't care if it was on next or it could be on something else, but MDX is the thing that I really like. It works best for me. I love writing a markdown and I love being able to create little components, little things I can throw in the middle of like a blog post with react because I know react well, it makes me fast and comfortable. And I think that's the key to making anything like, you know, is you don't want to spend all day like reading docs to try and make this thing if you're trying to get stuff out quickly. So just to back it a little bit, MDX is markdown with JSX, meaning you can import react components into your markdown and then they render and you get interactive interactivity versus how you might have used to do it via an iframe or some other mechanism to, to like inject some other piece into it. You get this like native ability to put react components in markdown, which is. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you for clarifying that for the listeners. I really appreciate that. That technology has been really useful for me. My, my blog has been in MDX for years. I've always wanted to be able to take my lessons to the next level, which I think meant marrying what we talked about earlier about video and written content and not making it just like one-to-one transcriptions like MDX was a simple way forward for me to be able to author things in a way I'm very comfortable and fast with while still having the option to create interesting things. For example, maybe making a quiz or making an interactive component that teaches people a little thing, or, you know, excuse me, giving them a chance to see a diagram that I was able to make with something. I don't know. That wasn't just an image. Something to interact with. So. What was the biggest surprise then? What you didn't think about and kind of ran into that might've been a technical hurdle? Well, actually, to some degree for me, it was the first time interacting with Stripe. So I had to make a choice. Do I do this with client side sessions or do I do this with server sessions? I, you know, to some degree, I think even Stripe people who reached out to me said I chose wrong, but I wanted to make it as simple as possible and I did the client side stuff, but it does have limitations. So you had to make choices. Other things would be like, you know, I tweeted about this. I said, I didn't realize some serverless functions, you really need to make idempotent. But the idea that like, if this accidentally gets hit a few times with the same information, please don't make multiple purchases or please don't give them seven licenses, you know, whatever it was. So I actually learned that one the hard way. Luckily, the way I had it structured, like it just showed up as the course showing up several times in their course list of what they'd bought. Like it wasn't like they had extra licenses to give to their friends. You weren't billing them over and over again with a runaway serverless function. I've had more than a couple of runaway serverless functions in my time. So I understand. Lesson learned quickly and hard, you know. How is building a course platform, building and designing a course platform different than the content production? Because it feels like they're two totally different skill sets to me, but you know, I think it's interesting to think about the platform as well.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"the delivery mechanism for the, you know, course content that you're creating. And it's important. I think it is important how it is delivered, but how, what's the, you know, like, how do you, how are they different in your mind? They are totally different. To be honest, I don't necessarily recommend people go build a platform. For me, it was an experiment in learning how to build like business functioning, like building a business. You really want to get in there and do it from scratch. Like not, that was that you were, you had an itch and it's not that you couldn't pick something off the shelf even you wanted to get in there and do it at a low level. And even if like your thing is you want to focus on being a teacher, right? Like not, you know, teachers maybe shouldn't have to do all the other stuff. And I think that's where a place like egghead really makes a lot of sense for people who want to be educators, but don't want to learn marketing, for example, or something like that. I think the big difference is like, you really need to think like a product person when you're building a platform. Like you need to think in terms of, okay, what features can I build out that will maybe differentiate what features do I have to have? Because everyone's just going to expect them. What things can I get away with not having at launch? What things can I add later? Like you really become a product manager of your own, your own thing. You know, like you can't just sit there all day and be like, I'm just adding this you, you really need to be decisive and judicious about what you're building. Okay. What can I add that fits whatever Kyle Shevlin offers to people? And I don't know if that makes any sense, but it does to me. It's like, you don't go out to try and be like everyone else, like you recognize competition or you, I don't even want to really call it that, but you know, you recognize where people in the space specialize and you have to ask yourself, what do I add? How can I amplify that? How can I reach people with what I add? It's funny when you describe this and I asked the question is what are the differences? And you talk about it like a product and what should I add and how do I build this? And it needs to represent my voice. And it's funny to me because I think the better question maybe was what, how are these experiences of building and designing a platform the same as building and designing a course? Because frankly, what you described to me is very similar to what we've described as like the course construction process, right? Like where the course is the product and then the platform is the product and you have these two different things and those, there's a lot of, maybe there's a lot of overlap in there even, which is just kind of a different way to flip it on its head and you almost get the same answer. But you know, like they are very different, like they're different products, like a platform is different from a course, but at the same time they are both like this thing that needs to serve the needs of the users and the person that's, you know, like creating and all these kinds of kind of multifaceted aspects of building a marketplace and then the products that sit on the marketplace. Yeah, I agree. I see that. And I didn't intentionally do that, but I agree because you know, you make a course, you have to consider who is consuming the course or, and stuff like that. So there's, there are these like meta level decisions that you make either implicitly or explicitly when you're designing it. That's not really that different from doing product design. So. How do you know when it's good enough to ship? Do I know? At some point you gotta launch it, right? Like it has to go out into the world. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I'm not going to bullshit anyone with, you know, if you're feeling comfy, it's too late. You know, I don't know any of that crap. I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to build anything that gets into YC someday. For me, it was just, do I feel comfortable with what I have done for the price I'm going to offer it, you know, to people, but to me, it was just like, okay, I've written all the posts I've made as many videos as I feel are necessary. There's a few more I could maybe make, but these are the necessary ones. They're done. People can go through the workflow and they can buy shit. There's no other bells and whistles other than the discord invite launch. Let's go. The only smarter thing I could have maybe done other than I sent out an email to my email newsletter list, but maybe I could have hyped them up for some time, like actually had a planned date and do a launch and, you know, optimize for money. But for me, it was optimizing for, I finished something. People who maybe don't have ADHD, maybe don't understand, but like 90, 95% of the things I start don't get done. Like I have a music folder sitting here with 500 half written, half finished songs, you know? Um, so to me, I have to optimize for, if I like, I have to optimize for just finish. It don't matter. So to me, once I felt like they could go through the workflow, do everything is, is just hit publish. Let's go. Did you do any testing? Like were you with learners or any other way before you launched it? No, I did reach out to a few people. I guess maybe I did. I didn't do it intentionally. It wasn't like. It wasn't a strategy. Yeah. I reached out to a couple of friends, a few that I knew who had struggled with reduce in the past. Cause that was the only course I had done for the platform. And I said, Hey, can you watch a couple of these lessons and tell me what you think? And I got good feedback back. Truth is I probably need to gain some more people who will give me critical feedback. You know, that's a challenge really. Yeah. But you know, they seem positive about it. And to be frank, I was banking on the success I had prior, like success I've had with egghead success I've had with my blog. I'm like, I feel I maybe haven't codified it. I feel like I have some sense of like when I've made a good lesson or a not so good lesson. And you know, I just trusted my gut a little bit and enrolled with it. What kind of changes do you think you'll make for the next course that you really say, do you have like platform changes or things that you'd like to see improved? Either with the course design process or the platform itself. The next one I want to do, I have ideas of which one will end up, but I'll just say things I'm going to add are actual like licenses. So companies can buy an X amount of licenses and distribute them to their, to their employees. That just seems like an obvious way to increase revenue and to increase distribution. So I have to build out that feature or find someone who's built it. I'm sure someone has, but I'll probably build it from scratch cause that's what I'm doing to learn. Other things I'm going to add are, I would like to add little maybe like quizzes or checks throughout the course of have you learned this thing? One thing I'm going to do is the, the courses will do more like hyperlinking between the lessons just so, cause as concepts overlap, like one of the things that was tough about state machines is you really needed to know four or five concepts all at once to do one lesson. And there wasn't an easy linear path. So just making it more networked within the lessons, cause I think it's just so easy to have an autoplay feature or something and just go. Yeah. Build out that graph basically. Right. Yeah. And then on top of it, I'm toying with the idea. I haven't flushed it out, but I'm toying with the idea of a little choose your adventure kind of stuff. If I'm teaching react, we get to a point like, how do I style react apps? Well, there's a bunch of choices. They're all good. They all have trade-offs. Like, and so like maybe at this point, like for styling, for example, you could try for Kate, I don't even know if that's a word between CSS modules, CSS and JS and Tailwind, you know, and like maybe the course has one linear path with just here's a two lesson tangent down this other path that you can kind of do. I imagine whatever my current like table of contents is just a list. I imagine that'll get some changes in the future. Yeah. That makes sense. Kyle, I really appreciate it. And I really think that it's great to watch. And I like always appreciate when people go out there and have that, that just Jones and desire to build from scratch. Like it's just impressive because it's, you know, there's a lot of choice out there and we can just go pull stuff off the rack, but to see people like honestly go out and build something for themselves is inspiring to me and I love to see it. And I love to see your enthusiasm, teaching people and kind of sharing what you know, and helping developers and all that fun stuff. It's been a great experience on my end, just to watch you grow and put this stuff out into the world. So thank you very much for doing that and taking the time to chat with me. Absolutely. Thank you for, thank you for all the ways you've helped me in doing this too. I appreciate it deeply and thank you for this chance to share my thoughts and have this chat too. Absolutely. My pleasure. Thanks Kyle. Thanks Joel.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"You've built something very cool with CSS for JS devs, you built your own platform, you designed and released a course that lots of people have used and loved, and you're selling that online. But first I want to ask you, and I've seen you talk about this before, and it's always fascinating to me, how people learn new complex subjects. What is your approach when you're digging in and learning something? And I know recently you've done that with like 3D graphics, right? How do you think about, you know, like a new challenging topic to get in there and learn it quickly and efficiently? Yeah. I mean, that's always the hardest is when you're starting something right at the beginning, cause you don't know what you don't know yet, right? You don't even know where to start sometimes. I don't know that I have any grand strategies. I think that when I'm starting something new, there's really no choice, but to find some sort of tutorial or video or course, right, something that kind of walks you through those early steps. So I'll go and find that, like with 3D modeling, I just spent a lot of time on YouTube, right? 3D modeling is one of those things that video is a really good format for it because for anyone that's ever opened Blender or a similar 3D rendering application, it's just buttons everywhere. It's like the cockpit of a plane. And so it's not the kind of thing you can jump in and just start experimenting with and a text-based article would need to have so many screenshots. So, you know, I kind of thought, okay, video makes sense for this. Let me watch some video. And then once I started getting my bearings, I would try to like extend what I've learned or do something similar, right? So if you follow a tutorial that has you build like a little motorcycle, see if I can make like a bicycle or a car, right, something that's in the same, mind you, all three of those things would be very complex, so not really super beginner friendly, but yeah, essentially just try and switch the balance so that, because I feel like there's limited utility in watching someone do something, right. Or even doing the same thing that person is doing, right. Kind of copy pasting, or not copy pasting, but just like recreating their exact motions, right. That's a very good way to learn how to, yeah. Like it teaches you how to do the specific thing that you're watching the video for, but then when you try to apply those skills to something similar, you realize very quickly, like, oh, I haven't actually learned the general skill of 3D modeling. I've learned how to build this object and that object. You've learned how to make a donut. Right. Yeah. So it's a matter of trying to find that balance of starting by watching passive content and then more and more. And by, you know, once you get to a certain point, like now with 3D modeling, and I'm still pretty much a beginner, like I don't know enough to do a lot of things, but I know enough to build a handful of objects. And so most of my time now is just, I have this, like, let me see if I can model something on my desk or some like idea that I have in my head. And I think it's fantastic that you have that capability. I was a 3D modeler in my previous career. And it's funny because just that particular topic at that time, it was literally, you went to Barnes and Noble and you bought the new writer's book and you went through and it was screenshots and it was all step-by-step. And I think it's really fantastic that we have this capability in these courses and we don't have to go to school and do that necessarily. We can, but we have so many options available. What do you think, like, if you're thinking about a course or, you know, courses in general, what are the qualities of a really good course in your experience? Yeah. So my own philosophy around this is that, actually two things I want to talk about. Sure. One is that it's really important to be entertaining and for the person to be enjoying it. I think that's why so many courses have such low completion rates is that if it's just like a slog to get through, then it's really hard to have the self motivation. Right. It's not like when you're in school and there's external pressures on you. In most cases, you buy a course, unless maybe like your employer buys it for you and there's an expectation there. Most of the time, it's just, you want to learn a thing, you buy the course, and now it's on you to do this thing. And trying to keep it like kind of fun and lightweight, that's really important. The other thing, and we kind of alluded to this a little bit already, is to try to make sure that there's an element of active practice, right? So it shouldn't be that the person can watch the course on their phone. Like I do like the idea of making things accessible to people who only have phone, but unless you're opening a code editor on your phone and actually trying things out, right, it shouldn't be that passive. There can be passive elements. So my course has something like 170 videos. So there's plenty of video, but those videos are sprinkled between other bits of content where it's like, here's an exercise and critically, the exercises aren't just do the thing that I just did. It's build this slightly different thing. I'm trying to incorporate some of that active learning where I'll show you A, B, and C, and I'll ask you to do D, right? Like there's a little bit of an extension that goes beyond what we've covered. Do you give away the answer to those? Or is it always, because you know, like one of the challenges in book learning, right, like when you're reading a technical book, they'll always have the now do this section at the end, which is, is always the hardest, right? If you don't truly understand something and you encounter that, it's like, Oh my gosh, I don't even know how to do this. Do I read the chapter again? Or, you know, like how do I do that? And I'm wondering, you know, like how, at what point do you release somebody into the wild to learn their own, you know, without the support structure of, you know, like, just do what I tell you, right? And I think that's what we're saying, right? Like there's like, follow the directions. Just like I tell you, now you've built that thing. Now build this slightly different thing. And, you know, is there a balance between the guide rails, I suppose? Yeah. So in my own case, every exercise will have a solution video. And what I tell people is take five or 10 minutes on this thing. And it's totally okay if you can't figure it out in that time. One of the things, actually, the first lesson in my course is all about trying to get people to have the right mindset. Cause so many people, myself included, like I'm not exempt from this. You want to be good at something and you don't want to struggle and you want to just glide through it, right? You want to be the genius that figures things out right away. You don't want to be the person that's kind of struggling through something. But the only way to learn something effective is to struggle. Like the only, we learn so much more from failing at something than we do from succeeding effortlessly. And so if we can change our mindset, if I spend 10 minutes on this and I make some progress, but I don't get the right answer, that is still like an incredible success because you've learned more than you knew 10 minutes ago, right? You experimented, you made a couple of connections in your mind, then you watch the video and that fills in the rest of the blanks, right? Again, I want it to be fun. I don't want it to be punishing where it's like, here's this massively difficult problem that I've given you very little guidance for. And now you're on your own. So I still want to make sure that people are encouraged, that it's totally fine. I also say that like, I have this kind of idealized version of how this should go where you try the exercises, you give it five, 10 minutes, you watch the video. But I make clear, like, this is your course. Like I'm not looking over your shoulder, trying to make sure that you're doing it properly. If you want to watch the solution video first, go ahead. I don't think it's quite as effective, but ultimately it's a lot more effective than getting frustrated and never touching the course again. So it's like all carrot, no stick at that point, right? Like you can literally push the button and just watch the video, but you are doing nothing but kind of taking away from ultimately your own learning experience, unless you already got it and you're just reviewing and at the end of the day. And that's really none of our business. That's your business, right? Yeah. And this is something I've actually had to learn a little bit because you mentioned, right, before I did this, I was developing curriculum for Concordia bootcamps, which is a local coding bootcamp. And in the coding bootcamp, people have paid like over $10,000 and they're committed to this thing. Right. And so you can lean a little bit more into the, like, having it be a little bit more frustrating, trying to optimize for effect rather than just like it being really fun and lightweight because the, you know, obviously you still don't want it to be miserable, you never want it to be miserable, but it's okay to allow like 20 minutes of struggling instead of five minutes, because you know that the person isn't going to abandon the program based on that and it's going to be more effective, but ultimately it is about finding the right balance. I think there's always a balance between the kind of direct support, you know, like you might have in a classroom style environment versus this idea of a self-paced course, so the balance even gets a little trickier when you're talking about that, I would suspect. Yeah, that's a good point because it's true that in our bootcamp, we had people, myself included, a lot of the time on hand to help people when they got stuck, which I try to make available to a degree in the course. Right. We have a discord community. People are encouraged to ask questions, but I'm not there 24 seven. I have hired someone that's there part-time to help out as well, but you know, it's not the same where you're not going to be able to get someone immediately in like a one-on-one dialogue to be able to walk through problems. You have to be a little bit more generous with what you share so that people can unstick themselves a little bit more easily. I think it's interesting too, because the price point is different, right? Like if you were there full-time and it was you providing that service, like you would have to, you know, like the price would have to be much more expensive and then not be as inclusive overall, and so there's all sorts of challenges. I also think that there's an interesting idea of like what fun is, because to me, fun is really kind of elusive and a lot of times fun means that there's a little suffering, that anxiety, like excitement and anxiety, right, are very closely aligned as emotions and feelings. So what is fun and how do you introduce that into like a learning experience? Yeah. And there's also just the dopamine hit of struggling with something and then the light bulb goes off and it's like, Oh, like now I get it. Right. And it's harder to have those moments, or at least those moments aren't as impactful if it was immediately obvious to you, or you just watched a video and let that moment absorb the very concrete thing that I'm teaching, but miss the kind of broader connections to the other stuff we've been teaching or learning. So you built your own course platform and I think that's awesome. It's something that I've done too. And it's like, I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want to, and you did really want to. And I'm wondering why, like what, what didn't exist for you and why did you need to build your own platform? Yeah. So the honest answer to this, there's like a half honest answer. I'll give you that one first. Yeah. Let's hear it. Which is that in my blog, right, I have this blog, it uses MDX. And I found it really useful to be able to embed whatever I want, right? If I can think of something, if I can build it with JavaScript and react or any other technology, I can just drop it into the middle of my blog post. So an example is I have a blog post on spring physics. It's one thing to describe spring physics, right? It's very hard in words, easier with like a video. You can watch the spring bounce back and forth, but even better if I can have a little handle that someone can drag and release and notice how that effect changes depending on how far they drag the handle, right? Being able to interact with it. And that's not something I think really exists in, especially not if you go the like commercial route of course platforms that are intended for non-developers. Right. There's kind of this growing movement of developer focused platforms, and maybe that will be able to let you do that. But certainly when I was starting my course platform, I couldn't think of anything else that could do that. Now that's the semi-honest answer. The fully honest answer is I just wanted to build my own course platform. The sheer challenge of it, like you want to sit out and have full control and build your own space on the internet. I'm a bit of a perfectionist. And I just, I knew that it, I wasn't going to be able to tweak anything off the shelf to be what I wanted it to be in terms of aesthetic and polish and feel. It's also a matter of, I like developing and this is even true to this day, right? I'm still, I'm working on my second course now and I bounce between building content and building, working on the platform and that kind of variety makes it much easier to sustain the energy to do this long-term I think, because it's not just 24 seven content creation. I'm able to do a bit of content and then mix things up and add some cool platform feature that I've wanted to exist. So I think having that just as a developer that what, other than my blog, I don't have any other major projects right now. I wanted to make sure that I still had that. Yeah. If you're consulting or working, you know, like on a job and a, at a service company as a developer, then you're constantly developing, but then at the same time, you're not getting the outlet of the content and do you actively balance that? Is that something that you consciously think about or is it just as you feel or what needs to get done? How are you balancing the platform versus the course content creation? Yeah, there's definitely some amount of structure. So one example is Fridays are my do what I want day. It's like kind of like my day off, but it's usually I'll pick some fun tasks to work on. Like 20% time ish kind of, kind of. Yeah, exactly. And it's almost always something whimsical with the platform. So it might be like a fancy invitation flow or like the, for people who have seen screenshots of my course platform, there's these like connecting, I call them bridges between lessons in a given thing. And they kind of swoop around. That was like a fun, a fun Friday project where there are things that I can't really justify otherwise in terms of like, will this help me sell more courses? Probably not. Will this make the education process that much better? Probably not, but it does incrementally have an impact. And when you take them in aggregate, right, when you have five or 10 of these things, they really do create a much better user experience. So that's like the organized part, but a lot of it is like, as you're going through the content, especially in my platform, because there's kind of a blurry line between content and platform. So one example is that I have these, like, I call them mini games. Really? They're more like quizzes, but they have kind of novel input mechanisms. So one of them is I'm trying to teach you the terminology in CSS. What's a declaration? What's a property? And rather than like, have this just be a multiple choice thing, I show you some CSS and ask you to select the appropriate subsection of that, just with the way you would select text on the web, right? Drag and select some chunk of it. And so that was the kind of thing where I had this content idea that then required a platform component of, Oh, I need a mini game component and I need to handle this special input thing and I need to create, like, cause you know, not everyone can select, you have to have a lot of dexterity and a pointer device. So there is like a fallback where you can just kind of type in the part of the code that is applicable and all that stuff takes a lot of time. So often, Sure, especially if you're considering accessibility and you know, like you're going to have one way you do this, but maybe they need keyboard entry or lots of people want to, you know, so you are capturing the most and making sure everybody can participate. Yeah. And it is the only thing I haven't done really well, at least not yet, is in terms of screen reader support, right? So I do assume that you can see the screen. And a lot of that is that I'm building a CSS course and I am not skilled enough to know how to teach CSS without a visual aid, right? So much of it is just, here's a mock-up and design it or implement this design. But in terms of a touch control, right? In terms of motor control, when I was starting to build the platform, I actually couldn't use a keyboard or mouse. I was having some nerve issues. So in fact, even the first bit of the platform in the first game was developed without those tools. So of course I needed to make sure that they were usable without those tools. And it's just, it's been something that I've tried to keep up with as well as I can, but you don't need a mouse. You don't need a touchscreen or a trackpad, right? If you have a keyboard, you should be able to do everything that you need on the platform. That's cool. You mentioned mini games and this has come up a lot as I've talked to people about course platforms and instructional design. And I'm wondering how, are you a gamer and has that affected your instructional design philosophy? Yeah. I mean, I am a gamer. I do, you know, it's, I don't think the games in my platform are going to win any like game awards. No, that's not their point. Yeah. But it is just a matter of let's take something, especially when I have something that's a little bit dry and I think I can make it a lot like terminology and CSS, right? Like it's one of the most dull things you can imagine, but you wrap it in the kind of, I don't know, no analogy comes to mind, but you deliver it in this mechanism and suddenly it's not so dull. Like it's a little bit more interesting to learn about the difference between a declaration and a property and a style, right? Like it, it just makes it a little more interesting. And I think part of it too is novelty, right? Like, and I've tried to make sure that the games themselves are like actually effective and the whole thing isn't just about novelty and not just there's eye candy or whatever, it's all, it's all there for a purpose at the end of the day. But there is something to be said for the novelty of, oh, this is interesting, right? I've never seen this before. Not only because it makes the course more enjoyable, but it makes the content more memorable. So it actually, I think makes it more effective if it's something new and interesting and different and that I think that sticks with people a little more. I know for sure. Like I've, I've read white papers and research that, that while people are learning, occasionally you have to shake them up, right? Like if you drone on and on for three hours with same tone and cadence, like you're just going to lose people. Or if it's an online course, if it's the same thing over and over again, if there's no surprise at all, people just aren't as likely to engage. And I don't think completion rates are super important, but it is right. Like getting people through it, if you want them to leave, cause they've learned what they came to learn, not because they got bored and just like, like petered out of the whole thing, I think. Yeah. And that is something that I was trying to be conscious of too. You know, I used to work at Khan Academy and one of the things I learned at Khan Academy is that when Sal Khan, the founder was starting, you know, it started as a YouTube channel, it's since developed into a much broader platform. But YouTube at the time had a 10 minute video limit. That's how long your videos could be. And so we kind of had to find a way to take these somewhat complex, like mathematical topics and break them into 10 minute videos, and it wound up really working to his favor because it's hard to watch a video for more than 10 minutes. Like that turns out to be a decent increment where you can watch it for 10 minutes and take a break before the next one. And you know, the fancy terminology that I've used is that my platform is multi-modality. There's all kinds of different modes, right? So, and I try to do kind of the same thing where there are a couple of videos that are on the longer side where it's like deep dives into a particular exercise or problem, but for the most part, the videos are like five, 10 minutes. And then there'll be like an interactive article and an exercise and a mini game. And it's, you're always bouncing between these different formats. And I think that really helps you stay engaged for a longer amount of time. Yeah. I've read that like learning styles is it's like one of those controversial kind of things that have talked about in instructional design circles, where it's more like teaching styles and you know, like we all kind of absorb information in certain ways, but you know, like it's really about this variety of. Teaching styles and delivery so that you're covering the gamut. And then somebody that has, you know, may learn one topic in one mode is might learn another topic in a different mode. And we're always kind of cycling just the brains back and forth. So like instructional design, matching that, and I don't think we see a lot of that. I see, you know, like you talked about the platforms that are kind of selling internet real estate, where you go in and you can slap your videos up there with some text underneath. It's all same. And it's just by the nature of the tools that we have at our disposal. Yeah. I mean, it's one of those things where if you're building a course platform that a gardener can use and someone who teaches cooking, right? Like there, in order to be broad enough to support every possible use case, you have to be really generic in the tools that it provides because you can't build specialized tools for every particular niche and topic. So that's one of the advantages of I can actually build the tool that I think would be most effective for teaching this particular thing without having to worry about whether I can kind of bend the platform to fit the shape that I want. Yeah. On a topic by topic basis too. So if like one topic deserves something else or needs something else, you can really dig in and that's very cool. Like that's, yeah. And that's actually something I've found that different modules in my course have a totally different distribution, like the Flexbox module, for whatever reason, I found most of the lessons in that topic have a video, or maybe that's not all video, but most lessons will have a video and for whatever reason, there's just a lot of things in Flexbox that really help to like show you visually and say, okay, well, here's this widget and here's why you do this. And this is what happens with this. And then often what I'll do is I'll put the, I'll build like a little interactive tool, I'll have a video that teaches something with this tool. And then the tool will be underneath. So you can kind of continue those explorations. Oh, so like, it's like watch and then play. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Was there anything surprisingly either technical or otherwise that the, about building your own platform that that's came up during the process? I mean, none of it was too unexpected. The only thing that really comes to mind is just that it took so much longer than I was expecting. I was thinking I would build the course and the platform in like three, four months, and I had the incredible luxury of doing this full time. So I had left my job. Granted, I was dealing with a disability at the time. So I wasn't like with my, I mentioned my arms. I wasn't working at full clip, but I was still working reasonably quick. And it took me about 13 or 14 months to develop the course and the platform. It was about half and half. I would say like half of that time, more upfront was on the platform. Cause I needed like user accounts and to figure out the stack and all of the different things that just go into any web application, and then of course, all the platform, all the con like the core specific stuff of the minigame component and all the little widgets and stuff, so it did, it took a lot longer than I kind of thought, right. Over a year full-time work, which is why, and you mentioned this earlier that like, whether or not most people should build their own course platform. I would have struggled to do this if I had other obligations. Like if I was trying to do this part-time on the side, I don't know that it's, unless you want to be really tightly scoped to a particular problem and like, you know, there's always ways to do stuff and it's just about figuring out the trade-offs, but I think it's probably a much more straightforward route to go the, using a prebuilt or other platform. If you don't have like a good amount of time to sink into it. Yeah. I think, well, I mean, you went for kind of a grand scale, I think also, right? Like you, you aren't teaching just a module, you are teaching people CSS as a complete picture. And I think that's a real, like both as a platform and the content challenges end up being rather significant when you, it just, you know, like you could scope that down and you could just teach somebody Flexbox for instance, in the terms of CSS, and that would be a much smaller scope project, but you were swinging for the fences, so to speak. That's a really good point that, yeah, there's 10 modules in the course. And I think most modules are long enough to be themselves a course. Yeah. I did the math a while ago. And like I said, there's 170 videos, 225,000 written words, 500 plus interactive widgets and exercises. Like it really turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected. Yeah. Grand scale for sure. Like that, and it's great because you know, like it's ambitious. And, and, but I think also, you know, like if somebody was sitting down to build their own thing, they could probably consider it at different levels. Right. Like, and I believe both strategies are great. And we've talked about it because, you know, like there's Kent's Epic React with grand scale, right? Like versus other courses, like an egghead course that we produce, which is, is not. Right. Like it's something that somebody can do and we can do over the course of weeks instead of months or years, which is, it's, it's always something to consider. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. So what's your process in terms of instructional design and when you sit down and you want to start working on a course and you're going to design a course from end to end outside of the platform, like what's your instructional design approach? Yeah. So I'm doing this right now. So it's the perfect time to talk about it. I start with a Markdown file that, and for the first, usually what happened is before I like formally start before I'm working on this as my main thing, I'm just like in my idle time having ideas, so I'll just jot down thoughts like, oh, this is something I want to make sure I cover, or this particular analogy is a really good way to explain this thing, or like here's an idea for a project. And over the course of maybe a few weeks, I'll gather a bunch of these notes and then it becomes time to like, okay, I want to actually start doing this. So I'll try to find organized piles of stuff, right? So figure out what the modules are going to be and what should be in each module, figure out what I want to cover in the course at all, or what I think is better left omitted, which is something I really need to work more on because I, my approach is generally that the scope just expands and expands and I'm trying to get better at like, no, actually we don't need to cover like every possible thing in the universe. And then once I have a solid enough skeleton where I have, let's say 10 modules, every module has like 15, 20 bullet points underneath it in terms of the different things I want to teach and some ideas around how, then I start with the actual content. So, and this too, I kind of take like, almost how I imagined you would carve something out of a block of stone where you start very coarse. It's like, okay, I don't need this huge chunk over here. And then you worry about the details later. So I'll just create a bunch of markdown files, just add like bullet points within them, those bullet points will become paragraphs. I'll have a lot of like to do comments, like to do interactive, whatever to do video that covers these five things. because what I've learned is if you spend time doing really refined versions of that now, you'll realize two weeks later, oh, actually this is totally the wrong way to cover this, or I don't need to cover this at all. And you've just wasted all that time. So I try to come up with like as broad as possible at first, and then slowly whittle that into something that looks more or less complete. In the past, I've done this module by module. So I'll finish all of module one, all the videos, all the interactives, and then I'll move on to module two. This time around, I'm thinking that maybe I shouldn't do that. Like maybe I should keep things a little bit coarse, because there is obviously relations between modules and you can still have the same thing where you're going through module two and you realize, oh, there's this really important thing that we need to know at this point. And it makes more sense to cover it in the past module. So I do think it's, I've had a lot of success, not going too detailed too soon. Right. So try to save a lot, especially like, it depends what's difficult for you. In my case, videos are really hard. Like it usually for a five minute video, it might take me two hours because I have to plan for it. I have to figure out what I'm going to do. It takes me five or six takes easily. That's pretty quick to be honest. Like video is way harder than I think people maybe give it credit for. It's challenging, right? Like, and the thing that's really challenging about it for me, at least, is after take two or three, I'll start to get frustrated and that frustration will show in the video and so I'll watch it the next day and I'll be like, well, I look miserable in this, so let me trash this and start again today. Yeah. There have been times where I've had to just ditch like many minutes, if not hours of video, because I just didn't like how unhappy I looked in them. I've cursed in many a microphone, so I understand. So that's the most, I try to save videos for the end. And I also, I'm trying to think now too, like if something is changing soon, like if I'm covering React and it's this like experimental suspense API, maybe don't use a video for that because if that changes next week, I don't want to have to rerecord it, right? Use articles that are easier to tweak and keep videos for the higher level ideas of, you know, just in talking about how React works, that's probably not going to change fundamentally. So that's a safer thing to do video with. But it also, I think, depends on the person, right? Maybe some people are just naturally charismatic on video, but struggle in terms of articles or these interactive things that might take them a long time to build. So I think it's about trying to optimize for your own personal, what you're good at, what takes you the longest. I've heard of people that will like dictate, you know, like do their writing through dictation, whether they're speaking and then refining it later, you know, so you would speak it. And to me, like what you've described sounds a lot also like if you're going to sit down and write a book, right? Like we're going to.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"and outline the whole thing. And then, you know, we start at this low resolution picture and then we tighten it and we tighten it and we tighten it until you're down to the video, which as you said, to me, this is extremely smart. The videos are going to change where the text is easy to update. Video is very difficult to update. It's dense, it's hard to update. It's not super accessible because you then, you know, like transcripts and stuff make it more accessible, but you know, like it's a visual medium. So, you know, like that balance between text and video and thinking about those modalities is really interesting as well, I think. How has been like maintaining your course so far? I think you picked a pretty evergreen topic, right? Like I think there's a lot of CSS that's going to carry you for years, but what's the, like the maintenance process been like for you? Yeah, so there's been a lot and most of the maintenance is my own fault. Like it's not so much that the language changes, it's that someone will point out that I've made a mistake or there's some like, or if like five or six people have the exact same question, but they're like, hey, my code isn't working. Why isn't this code working? And they've all done it the same way. Then it's like, oh, well clearly I'm not explaining this very well because so many people. So that's what is, most of it's just been that is, okay, this thing, clearly there's a problem here in terms of the instructional design. So let me figure out how I can address this. And I've probably done like 15 to 20% of the course has been redone since launch with those types of things. Maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe 10%. Some like, it's not zero, but it's also not like huge. I do think that part of me, here's another thing that's frustrating too, is because I'm doing that module by module, I'm embarrassed by module ones and two and three. I've gotten so much better at making courses. So module 10 is like, in my mind, so much better. And the smallest number of people will see that, which is frustrating. Because it's at the very end and completion rates are what they are. So yeah, like, yeah. Yeah, so it is, but there's no other way to do it because I can't go in reverse order because I kind of need to know what's already been covered so that I can say, as we saw last module, like here's something I can take for granted. And then here's the new thing. I think it'd be a lot harder to go backwards. Do you think you'll spend time going back and actually redoing those, the modules that are frustrating for you, or you look at now and you're like, that is just not it anymore. Are you going to go back and actually refine those? Because you said you're working on a new course. I'm wondering where you balance like, well, I'm going to make a new course on a different topic, or I'm going to keep refining this course that I've already created. Cause it could be, you know, like I know in my heart, it could be better. How do you consider that? Yeah, so I really struggled with this and a big part of me did want to make version two of the CSS course right now. But it's true that most of the language hasn't changed very much yet, but it will. Container queries are right around the corner and there's all kinds of different additions to CSS that are going to really change how to solve certain problems. And you know, maybe it'll land in six months. I won't want to do it right when it's safe to use because I want to have my own time experimenting with it and figuring out the best ways to use it. So the kind of resolution that I've made with myself is there will be a version two of the course, probably in like a year or two. Like I'll wait until the content, not only for my own personal standards, because a lot of this too, is that you're your own harshest critic, right? Like I've gotten very few complaints about the quality. And so really it is just, I look at things and I think they could be better, but most people look at it and they think it's good enough. So I'm kind of using the fact that if I redid it now, I'd have to redo it again in a year anyway as justification for spending my time elsewhere. But it's a really good point that when I started on this journey, like I said, I thought it would take me three, four months to do a course. I thought I'd push out like two or three courses a year and I'd have like a whole catalog before too long. Now I'm thinking like in my lifetime, maybe I'll have four or five courses. And even that might be, because there is a maintenance cost and there is an ongoing need for these courses and the world changes. So like I've heard from some course creators that aren't in the tech space. There's a piano creator that created a piano course and he's had one course for seven years and the sales just keep getting larger and larger every year because he's making the course better and because piano continues to be a thing people wanna learn. So I do think that it's surprisingly viable to just pick one or two things and create those courses and then continue to improve them over the time rather than always jumping to the new. It's kind of a quality over quantity kind of question. And not that you can't make four or five high quality courses, but that idea that instead of trying to crank out several less ambitious courses every year, you're going to work on this and really consider it. I think that that's a great approach. One of the things I think people get hung up on and you seem to be pretty good at is this, you know, like the ideas for projects and interactive widgets and what's the secret sauce? Like how can we all be great at making awesome examples that people love to do? Yeah, that is a good question. And I don't have a great answer. Yeah, it's a complicated answer at the end of the day. I mean, I think that there's practical considerations, but ultimately it's really dependent on intuition. So it's a matter of like, I'm thinking, okay, I want to teach this thing. I'll give you an example. I'm building a React course. One of the early lessons in that course will be thinking in components, right? How do I take a design and figure out where to draw the boxes around what component should be where? And I thought, well, drawing boxes would be a great way to do that, right? Make a little thing where you literally draw boxes on the screen, and then I'll show you how my boxes look and you can compare the two. And that just, it's hard for me to describe like how to come up with those sorts of ideas. They kind of just happen. But I think they happen because I have this blog that also has these interactive things that I've done over a hundred blog posts now, I think. So a lot of it is just through like pure experimentation and practice over the course of years, but it is certainly a skill worth developing because, and that is like, and this is kind of a related question. How do you come up with like an example that is both simple enough to illustrate the concept that you're trying to teach, but not so unrealistic, like where the variables are called foo and bar, right? You want to have something that has real world that looks like the code you would write in your job. But the problem is that the code that you write in your job has all these different dependencies and edge cases and all of that complexity would be overwhelming. It is hard. Like it's not something I feel like I've mastered yet. It's something that I'm still kind of working on and trying to find the best example that covers the most amount of ground with the least amount of complexity. I think what's interesting is that you describe it as a skill and that's probably the best way to look at it. It's not like you were born with this ability to spin cool examples and, you know, like add fun, whimsical widgets to blog posts. It's something that you sat down, thought about, and have worked on for years to get better at and you still like aren't finished in that process at the end of the day. Yeah, exactly. And I think people that may be familiar with my blog, very few people are familiar with the fact that I had a medium blog before my custom blog. And I think I have like 50 or 60 medium posts and almost all of them are terrible. Like they are not worth looking at because they were my first blog posts, right? I don't have the natural gift that the first blog post I write is fantastic. I don't know that anybody does, right? Some people are better writers than others, I suppose. There's so many different little things that you have to be aware of in terms of pacing and trying to forget that you know things, right? Like the curse of knowledge is a real thing where it's really hard to put yourself in the position of someone who doesn't know this thing that you know and that's you're writing a blog post because you want to teach them something, but you have to know what it's like not to know the thing and it's really hard. So it does just take a lot of- It's just true across a lot of skills, right? Because the same is true for programming computers. Like how do you get good at programming computers? It's programming computers. That's always- And how do you get better at writing? It's like write, painting, paint. Like, you know, it's like these are difficult skills that you don't get to like have a magic bullet that embeds this skill into your hands and brain and arm movements and all that fun stuff. It's just work. And that's a tough pill to swallow sometime. I think it's good for folks that are willing to sit down and put in the work because it's definitely a competitive advantage. Yeah. So when people come to CSS for JS, what are they trying to achieve? What difference are they trying to make in their- Yeah. So, you know, actually it's interesting because I think if you had asked the average person who was familiar with my blog or my Twitter account what I was known for, they wouldn't tell you CSS. Like CSS was not kind of my thing, but what I- The thing that made me want to do CSS as a course was the realization that I knew so many people and I was in this bucket myself, who, you know, React developers, Angular developers, who were really confident with the JavaScript side and who had picked up HTML a long time ago, but who still struggled with CSS, right? People who just couldn't seem to get their intuition going and would always have these moments where they're going along, everything is great, and suddenly the box is in the wrong place or the flex thing is stretching too much or squishing too. And CSS is like a challenging language to really develop that intuition for, right? It's relatively easy to get started with, make the text red with color colon red, right? There's all these kind of immediate CSS properties that you learn, but then the problems of how do you build like a fully responsive, robust web application that does what you expect in this very implicit language. A lot of the CSS properties that we write have all kinds of like secret mechanisms that they fire off, right? There's things like containing blocks and stacking contexts and hypothetical sizes, concepts that you would not run into in your day-to-day life as a developer, but have this incredible impact. And I had kind of gotten through this transformation on my own where maybe like three, four years ago, I decided that I was really sick of having this experience of being knocked out of flow by some CSS. It's the same snippet I've used 10 other times and 10 other times it worked and now it's doing something different and I have no idea why, there's no error message, there's no console log, right? It's just not doing what I... And my solution for that was to really try to understand CSS at a deeper language. So I would go and read the MDN article for the properties that I'm using and follow the links to the specification and try to understand. And this was like a very time intensive process over the course of years, but it really helped me develop confidence with it. And because I was already reasonably confident with JavaScript and HTML, it felt like the final puzzle piece that was snapping in. And honestly, like I don't wanna oversell it because it's true, like I still run into all kinds of problems, right? I don't mean to say that CSS is now like everything always works the first time, but I'm so much more equipped to deal with the cases where it doesn't do what I expect, right? I have enough of a mental model in place that it usually doesn't take me that long to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. And that's made a tremendous impact on just my overall happiness as a developer. And the fact that CSS just doesn't change all that often. Those were kind of the considerations of like, why did I wanna do this course? And so in terms of a very long winded roundabout answer to your question about what people can expect to get out of it, hopefully the goal is to give you that same sort of confidence with the language where you're still gonna struggle with CSS every now and then, or you're still gonna run into problems where it doesn't do what you expect, but you'll have this kind of underlying tool set, this mental model of how the language actually works that you'll be able to solve those problems. You'll have like a procedures you can follow to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. You'll understand how the different layout modes work and how they're interacting to hopefully change like your overall experience as a web developer, because as much as we try to avoid it with different tools and different abstractions, CSS is always gonna be something that we need to write in one way or another, right? It's the only visual language the browser understands. And so it is really important to get comfortable with it. And that's kind of the goal of my course is to give you that comfort with it. And it's not that you're not gonna have to visit MDN. It's just, here's a shortcut to give you the literacy you need to like jump ahead and solve a lot of those problems and have that kind of, I don't know, reduce a lot of the cognitive load, I suspect, at the end of the day. Yeah. And just the problems that you can solve now that you could not solve before. I think that's exactly right, right? The goal, my, and this is maybe a little bit less ambitious, but still quite ambitious goal is that when you hit that moment of like, you write the code, you run it in the browser and it's not doing what you expect, instead of just being stuck and like, well, I guess I'll just throw random properties until I get what I want. It'll be like, okay, let me think this through. I know that move. So I think we all do. Yeah. It's more, so now the idea is it's like, okay, so I have these properties, right? This is how this layout mode works. These are kind of the constraints are on it. Oh, right, it's not working because I forgot to select my minimum width on this thing to zero. And so the Flexbox algorithm isn't letting it shrink below a certain point, right? That's kind of the hope that I have is you're still gonna run into these quirks, but you'll have kind of the tools needed to deal with them. So one of the things that I've noticed, generally speaking, when people talk about courses is marketing and this idea of marketing a course and like marketing is the most important thing. I was wondering if you think that's true and if like, how do you market your course? How do you think about marketing when you approach your course and the platform? Yeah, I mean, I do think it is really important that you can build the best course in the world. And if only like five developers know about it, it's gonna be really hard. Like, you know, I imagine there is always word of mouth. So maybe it will kind of slowly grow out of a small group, but really it's a tremendous advantage to be able to have people that are already following your work. And this was kind of the reason I felt confident going in this direction, right? Because I did, I left my job and I spent a year working on a course. It was about, actually, it was six or seven months between when I started working on it and when I had my early access launch. But still, that's a lot of time to commit on something that you don't know will work. And the reason I was relatively confident with that was that I already had a blog. The blog had reasonable traffic. I think it was maybe like 50, 60,000 visits a month. And I had like a Twitter presence and I was starting to build my newsletter, my email. And it's just kind of a numbers game, right? It's a matter of if I build this course and if the course is good, I will be able to reach out to, you know, 10, 20,000 people immediately and let them know, here's the thing that I'm doing. Some percentage of them will be interested in it. And that's kind of how you build that initial group that can then become the people that advocate for it and evangelize it for you, right? If your course is good, it will develop those sorts of relationships and it'll, that's the model that I had seen work for other people and that I imagined would work for myself and happily, happy to report, it seems to have worked pretty well. What channel do you think was the most effective for you? Where you have Twitter and your blog and your email list, what worked the best? So email definitely worked better than Twitter. I don't, you know, I didn't take super close care to collect the right analytics, but what I could see from the referrals is that people that had come straight from Twitter, they made up both a smaller amount of traffic and a lower conversion than people that came from email. But email was only possible because of the blog. So I think like ultimately the reason the course worked was the blog, right? The blog is what gave people both the exposure to me as a person and my work, but also the confidence that like, oh, this blog post taught me something. I bet if I buy the course, it will also teach me something, right? There wasn't really gamble of like, well, he seems like a nice person and all, but I don't know, like, will I actually learn anything? You can actually point to like, and actually what I did is maybe for five or six lessons, I just took the lessons out of the platform and put them into blog posts. They're not exactly the same because like I had to remove the videos and the exercises, but in terms of the interactive widgets and the articles, that's all the same stuff. And then at the end of those blog posts, I'm able to write like, hey, this was actually a lesson in this course. If you liked this lesson, you can go here to learn more about the course. And I think that's probably still the main, that and the email list are how people continue to discover. It's kind of a system that you described then because Twitter is part of that too, because you're announcing people and they don't have to trust you to, you know, like read your blog posts, but to buy your course, they would need to trust you more. So they end up at the course and don't convert. But if where the articles end up, you know, getting them on your list or giving you more of a sense of trust, I think that kind of cycle makes a lot of sense. I think especially like maybe, I mean, I only have myself, you would actually be a better person to answer this question than me, but my course is priced relatively high, right? It's certainly like in a different- I so disagree with that statement. Well, compared to say like the $10 courses on Udemy, right? There's kind of different categories of course. I think you're probably like a third of what you could potentially charge for it. I wouldn't say should, cause it's your course, but that's where I'm at. But anyway, I digress, go ahead. Yeah, you know, it's a matter of for someone to come and if they don't already know my work, why are they gonna give me hundreds of dollars, right? Like it's a pretty big ask in the best of cases. And I think the reason people are able to make that, to leap to that decision that it's gonna be valuable for them is that they've seen firsthand what I can do to help them learn. You've built authority and trust and you know, like you're giving them value so to speak for free anyway, and proving to them that they can take a risk with, you know, like a bigger leap. Yeah, and that's kind of my assumptions that the bigger the price, the bigger the leap, right? So the more you have to kind of have already shown them. I think if I didn't have a blog, but I did have an audience, it might make more sense for me to create a lower cost course because then people wouldn't have as much reticence or you know, nervousness about it because it's 20 bucks, it's 100 bucks, right? It might be an easier decision to make than oh, it's three, $400. I would challenge you to raise your prices and just see what happens. Just saying. I've raised them a couple times. It's relatively small and it's true. Like, you know, I already get a lot of people emailing me and they say that it's just not within their price range and I do feel a little bit, you know, it is. Well, I mean, they make books and there's all sorts of stuff that people can go do that might be more in their relative price range. And that's something I've started doing that I feel good about is I created a list of my favorite free resources because there's a bunch. And so now whenever someone asks about the price or like wants a discount, my response is always, well, look, there's many ways to learn CSS, right? I learned CSS without my course and here are the resources that I use that are free. Yeah, that's wonderful actually. That's a fantastic idea and a great solution to that too because it's true and you're being helpful. And then in the future, if their situation changes, then they're gonna think about, you know, Josh Gamo, the helpful CSS person that gave me this list of resources and now I'm ready to go big. Yeah, hopefully. Actually on that, maybe a year ago, I wrote a short ebook, Building an Effective Developer Portfolio. That's great, I've read it. I appreciate that. This was also, there was, you know, at that point I hadn't really decided I was building a course, but it was something that I had seen in my future. And the thinking here was, let me build this thing, it's gonna be free. And I'm gonna be marketing it to people that are just at the start of their careers. So I had this kind of idea that people are gonna download the book, it's gonna help them get their first job. And then when I create a CSS course, a couple of years later, they're gonna now have these, you know, higher paid jobs and they'll feel like, hey, this person helped me once, I bet they'll help me again. It hasn't converted as well as I, in fact, it's my lowest converting of my three lists, right, I had that list, I had my general blog updates list, people specifically who wanted updates about the course, right, that one was the highest because people wanted information about the course. But for people who were only subscribed to the portfolio book one, it was like a quarter or a fifth of the conversion of people that were only subscribed to my blog one and maybe others. So I was surprised by that. And I got the most complaints too, because I sent like five or six emails during the launch window. Please stop emailing me about your CSS course type of complaints, yeah. And like, whenever I would get one of those, I would check like, which list is this person subscribed to? And even though the portfolio list was maybe like 20% of my list, they were like 60 or 70% of the complaints. So I don't know why that is. I guess maybe it's that a bunch of people just saw a freebie online. It wasn't super applicable to them, but it was free. So they joined the list and they completely forgot about it. And now here's some random person sending them all this email. There's like a deep strategy there. Cause you know, like people talk about keeping your list warm and you know, like bridging people from one interest. I mean, you can like really get into like a deep rabbit hole. I always recommend Brennan Dunn's work in terms of if you really wanna go deep on that sort of segmentation and personalization, nerdery, it does go deep. And I also don't generally go that deep. I like knowing about it, but it's like, you can really get complex with it and strategic, I guess. Easier to just throw the noodle on the wall and see if it sticks. Yeah, I mean, I've done a little bit of experimenting with paid ads and it became very clear to me very quickly that this was a viable route, but it would require way more time than I wanna put into it right now. So it's about balancing. And I guess a solution to this could be hiring people or finding agencies that do this kind of thing. I'm kind of, if I make, maybe the biggest mistake that I make in terms of like just overall profitability is that I try to do everything myself. And part of that is just like, I don't really care if it's less, like I just enjoy doing it that way. I like the control that I have. And I like that like no one else is depending on me. Like I can just do whatever I want whenever I want without worrying about anything. Like that's, I really enjoy that freedom. And if I was working with someone that required me to set up certain analytics and that's overhead that I'm currently not optimizing for. But yeah. And it's also like, what's good enough for you too, right? If you needed that and you were optimizing for maximum revenue, that's one story. But if you're like, I want work-life balance, I want enough for what I need. And I wanna create something quality that I enjoy and I don't enjoy managing people or whatever that means. And that's a, I think that's a way to look at it. And like in terms of your own personal mental health and just general health, it's just a great healthy way to look at it, I think. Yeah, I agree. What's your most audacious goal with your course platform? If you were really thinking about it and you were like, where do I wanna be? What's an audacious goal that you've set for yourself? You know, it's interesting. I don't really have any audacious goals. You know, my goal is always just to make a living creating courses that help developers learn things. I suppose that, you know, my goal is for that to grow and for me to have kind of a wider and wider reach. But I don't really- That's more reasonable than audacious maybe too, I guess. Yeah, like, you know, I think a lot of people that do the kind of indie hacker thing have plans of raising money and hiring employees and becoming this world-changing company. And I have zero interest in that. In fact, like a bunch of people have mentioned to me now that the course platform, I should like build that as a SaaS and white label it and sell it to organizations. And that probably would be a great business, but I have no interest in it. So I guess like the most audacious thing about my goal is just that I want it to be, I want it to be growing every year until I reach a pretty substantial size of the market. But it's not really that, I wouldn't call that audacious. I think it's just- I think that's a reasonable and healthy look at it. I'd agree, it's not necessarily audacious outside of, you know, just the fact that you're running counter to what maybe is hustle culture or whatever you call it, where people want to do a startup or build a SaaS or, you know, be a billion dollar unicorn versus just, you know, helping a good set of people and make a comfortable living and not be stressed out all the time. Like that's nice to you, right? I mean, I think that they're both like, you know, if that's, if someone really wants to go that route then there's nothing wrong with that. It's just not a route that appeals to me. Yeah, I think that, yeah, for sure. And I'm pretty much there with you though. I've brought in more collaborators over the years and have learned to balance that. But at the same time, it's like, there's a level of enough and just kind of getting in there and doing good work and helping folks is pretty fulfilling in and of itself. Yeah, I mean, I should also say too, like I've been doing this for less than a year. So maybe like, as this becomes more normal to me, my kind of appetite will increase. But for now it's just, I want to do what I'm doing. Yeah, Josh, I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you for creating CSS for JS. I think it's an awesome resource and you really hit a sweet spot. And, you know, this idea that developers can not be so scared, cascading style sheets is a true thing. And I think it's going to be successful for years to come. I look forward to seeing what you do next and thanks for chatting with me today. Well, I appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hi, Angie. Hey, Joe. How's it going? It's going really well. I'm excited to talk to you again. I know we've chatted in the past and done a podcast episode, but a lot has changed in the meantime. You've done a lot of new things. I'm up to new things, and I thought we could come together and kind of talk about that. And mostly I'm interested in talking about courses and learning platforms and that sort of thing. Yeah. And you built something really nice with testing automation, you. But first I wanted to kind of break the ice a little bit. And I was wondering, when you sit down and you are personally learning something new and you have a new space that's open and you're going to sit down and learn something complex, what's your approach and how do you like to learn new things? Yeah, I really like when I'm given examples, you know, concrete information. And you would be surprised, well, maybe not you, but some people may be surprised just how rare that is. So when I'm researching new topics and things like that, there's a lot of kind of information and everyone tries to sound really smart. And it comes off like very academic versus, you know, practical. So what I do is, one, is try to find like someone that I can learn from, someone I can vibe with. And sometimes I have to go through a couple of courses before I find that. Just recently in something I'm learning, I can't really find one person that I vibe with. So I'm learning from a couple of different people and then trying to put it together so that I understand better. Yeah. And I don't know if you've experienced this and you kind of touched on it where the examples are rare or it feels like it's academic. I feel like a lot of times people are actually teaching theory to something that they've done in real life, which there's a huge difference, right? Theory is fine, but it's a big difference to me. I know. And then everyone kind of repeats what they learned from the other person. So like last night, I was looking for this definition of this concept in Java. And every resource I found gave like the exact same sentence as that definition. And none of it told me the, what is this used for and, you know, why would I want to use it? It was just like, oh, this is an interface that does X, Y, and Z. Why do you think that happens? What causes that and causes people to teach and just kind of recycle material? That's a really good question. And I think maybe not putting themselves in the learner's shoes, right? And so if I look up, well, how do I best describe this concept? And there's five or six authors who have all described it exactly the same. Then it's natural to say, okay, well, that is right, right? This has been confirmed by five or six experts. So I'll just say the same thing. And I actually need to teach that concept. So this is a really good example. I refuse to teach it that same way, Joel. So I'm trying to figure out right now, like how best, I'm basically in the learner's seat right now. Like I understand this in my head, but trying to communicate the concept out is going to be kind of challenging. So I'm trying to put myself in, okay, what if I knew nothing about this? What I would most want to know is not what it is, but why I want it. What problem does it solve? And then you can tell me like the academic little tidbits about it. But for right now, I just need to know the why. I think that you touched on something that's extremely important too, is that what is the problem being solved here? Why even bother doing this? And what am I going to be able to do when I get done is like a critical aspect that seems to get missed a lot. I know because in these tech courses, essentially what we're giving people are tools, right? And so you can teach me about a hammer, but if you don't tell me when am I supposed to use the hammer, then what good is that, right? Maybe I start using it all the time for everything or, you know, so I think that's more important than the what is the when and, you know, then I know, okay, here are all of my tools and I know what problems each one of them solve. So I know which one to grab when I face a certain problem. When you sit down and, you know, as an, and you say, you know, like you're trying to capture that beginner's mind, is your research process different when you're designing learning material than when you're learning something yourself or is there some overlap there? That's a good question. It might be a little bit different. Maybe, maybe there's some overlap, but a little bit of difference, right? I have a lot of foundational knowledge and so I can draw on that a bit. And so I try not to assume that my audience will have that same sort of knowledge, right? So I've been in tech for almost 20 years at this point. I might can skip ahead a little bit or just give me the, you know, the TDLR of this thing versus when I'm teaching, I try to go a little bit more into detail. Where do you draw the line in terms of the assumptions? Because there's, you know, like we, how many times are we going to like explain what an array is though somebody is going to need that and they might need to remediate and understand that. Like how far do you go back? What are the assumptions you're making when you're trying to teach? Yeah, that's a good question. I think it depends on the topic. So if I'm talking about something like maybe loops, for example, maybe that's not a good example. I was going to say, well, then I can make an assumption that you've already learned arrays or something like that. But you get what I'm saying. If I'm, if I'm teaching something that's applicable to another concept, I might just do a one liner kind of refresh your memory sort of thing, but not go into detail about it. When you're doing this, and I can't agree more that the examples are one of the most important things, like something that I can get into, I can dig in and feels pretty real. How do you think about those exercises when you're creating a course? Yeah, that's the best part of my courses, I think, is that I give realistic examples. So there's no full bar in my courses. I try my very best not to just, you know, give generic tails and variables, but I say let's solve a problem. And I take quite a bit of time trying to figure out good fun problems to solve that will really demonstrate the topics that I'm teaching. I draw from everything, like I'm notorious for putting like a little small game in my courses, you know, so let's build this game or whatever. And it could be like really simple, it could be a number guessing game or a dice game or card game, you know, something simple that won't take too long. But it's fun, it's something you can get behind, you understand it from a practical standpoint and now you just need to apply the code to it, you know? Yeah. How important is fun in learning? I think this is something that we debate and even the definition of fun can be kind of fuzzy, but like how important is it to have fun while you're learning or teaching? Yeah, I think it's extremely important because we're all so busy and it's very rare for someone to sit down in one sitting and take your course, right? They have to be motivated to come back. And if it's dry and boring and, you know, the examples don't resonate, then they're not going to come back, right? Unless they just absolutely need it, but they're suffering through. Even if they absolutely need it, they might go find someone else to get it from, that's a little bit more exciting. So I definitely try to add fun, I add little jokes in my course. Like I said, the projects are really fun, so let's build a game. I have one, let's build a lottery ticket generator and, you know, when you play the lottery and you win, don't forget about teacher Angie, you know? But I've actually had someone, you know, generate their numbers and they won a couple of bucks on a scratch off or something, not a scratch off, but a lotto ticket. Yeah, I think that it's really important that you make it engaging, just like anything else. If you're doing some sort of presentation or talk, you know, you want to be engaging. Same goes for a course. I also think that the other side of that is that there's this disconnect in training and like the real life processes of developing software in the enterprise. And I'm wondering, is there a way to bring those two together and still maintain that fun but deliberate, or is that just kind of covered by the example space and people are able to transfer that over? You know, I feel like that's a major gap, project based stuff in general. So a lot of the courses I see are very academic and they give you like bullet points of the information. Here's a topic. Here's the rules about that specific concept. Like the algorithm. Yeah. And then here's a very generic example. It's not specific to a real problem. I just want to show you, you know, the syntax of something, right? And what we're finding, and I truly believe this is why it's so difficult for a lot of people who are trying to enter into the tech space to find their first job. And you know, they've done all we've told them. They've taken the course. We gave them a list. Here's what you need to know. They did all of that. They haven't built anything. They don't know how to apply what they've learned to real enterprise type problems. You know, I really encourage instructors to add, you know, little projects to their courses. I do that with, in some of my courses, when I'm allowed to. Every platform won't allow me to do this. But when I'm allowed to, I try to add, you know, optional exercise to every single chapter that I teach so that you can, you listen to me. I go through an actual real world example as I'm teaching you. And then I give you another real world example, a problem to solve with the information that I've just taught you. And I think that's- So you can do it yourself, right? Yeah. So you can do it yourself without me. Like, it's easy to follow along when I'm showing you, but I want you to be able to do it yourself. And you might have to replay the video or look through the transcripts. That's fine. Right? That's what we do as developers. But I think applying that knowledge is the key, and many courses are missing that. And that's why these folks are having a hard time on the job. So I think we could still do the fun projects. Like I said, mine might be a game, but it's really making you think and exercise these concepts. We've talked about this on Twitter too, where people are building portfolios and they're not building portfolios that are reflective of the jobs that they want to get. And often that's a tough hurdle that you have to get past because you have to build something real to get a real job, I think, at the end of the day. Yep. Yep. And they are really struggling with that. One of the interesting disconnects that I've seen, and I don't know if you've noticed this as well, is when we're working, it's like this neat thing where you have product and engineering and marketing, and you have the C-suite and they're changing stuff on you. And have you ever thought about how you might simulate that in kind of a training environment to actually give people a chance? No, I haven't, and that's a really good observation. When we're teaching courses, it's very much an isolated experience, right? This is very independent. You're studying on your own. Even if you think about school settings, you get penalized if Google and find a solution, or if you work with someone else and it's not a group project. I think that's... And I didn't learn about a lot of that stuff, Joel, until I went to do my master's degree, is when they taught about software engineering, not programming, but software engineering, and talked about all of those different roles that come into play. Yeah, I know that there's a couple of interesting novels that have been written in narrative form that try to show people that, and I've heard like Microsoft does, they're internal, and they actually hire actors and kind of simulate the work environment. And I think that's an amazing concept, but I just haven't really even seen that. And even in my own teaching, it's always, here you are, we're talking about this, it's in isolation, you're working by yourself, you have some assets, but it's not... You're collaborating with a designer, which is a lot different than being handed a design or having to create your own. Have you found any way to test your learning content? When you're creating a course, are you able to test that with people, or do you just kind of create it for the event or the platform that you're building it for and kind of test it in production? So the ones on TAU, I didn't test those, I basically just let it ride. But on some other platform, like LinkedIn Learning is another one where I have courses, and they have a set of testers that take the course before it's released. And I thought that was really neat and helpful. And they'll call out continuity issues, and this isn't really clear, you kind of lost me here and there. So that's been very beneficial. Would that actually affect the course? Would you go back and fix those things or improve based on that feedback? Yeah, yeah, I do. I go back and I may have to record another little snippet, clarifying point, or something like that. It's a pain. But you know, if I feel like it's really necessary, then yeah, I'll do it. When you were building Testing Automation University, is that something that y'all built from scratch? Or did you use a framework or platform for that? Yeah, we built that from scratch, I actually hired a contractor to build that out. I didn't want to build it that way. But we decided to go that route, just to have a more flexible platform that we can add whatever features we wanted to. But if I were to do this all over again, I think I might go with, what do they call it? Learning management system. Okay, like a kind of a formal enterprise learning management system. Yeah, I hear those are pricey though. But that's true. Yeah, but I would rather go with that. It's a lot of work to deploy just a single course, right? Like I'm literally in here, I had like editors, and I'm converting transcripts to Markdown and all of this stuff. It was quite the effort, it would take me like a day or two to deploy a course. If you were designing, or you could snap your fingers and have the ultimate course platform at your disposal, what are some of the features that you'd have to have that you'd want to have to make those problems go away and deliver the better learning experience? Let's see, I would, I definitely need video, transcripts, quizzes, I really like gamification type things, so points. We added some things on Test Automation University, leaderboard and stuff like that. So for those who like competition, that's really fun as well. I like a lot of the elements that Josh has, what's Josh's last name? Yes. Yeah, his stuff is great. And his CSS course, like the interactive elements there, I would totally steal that sort of thing. It's inspiring what he's done, and just that ability to go through and touch the screen and have something happen, and it just ingrains it right into your brain, and I love it. Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that makes you want to come back and take the next lesson. I think gamification kind of gets a bad rap, like people think about that, and they think of tokens or something flying up in your face or whatever. But how has that improved the learner experience and people that have interacted with testing automation? It's been wonderful, right? So they have quizzes, and you get points for the quizzes, and like I say, we have a leaderboard, we have a TAU top 100, and so the people who are in the top 100 are pretty competitive, and so they end up taking any and every course that we put out because they want to get their points up and keep their slots, right? But I just think of, wow, think about the sort of tool belt that this person now has. We have our courses on test automation university are split amongst API and mobile apps, and so you're learning all of these different lanes and everything about them, right? How powerful is that? But yeah, they really enjoy it. We give little cute badges upon completion, so people share those and they share their certificates and things like that. So it's not an in-your-face kind of thing, but it's still really fun. So I was talking to Aman Zabi, who does the terrain.com is their course platform that they built. And I want to run this idea by you because I think it's one of the most interesting gamification techniques and kind of maybe aligns with your current interest, but they've taken and they give participation points to the learners, and at the end of the month, they take that pool and then they actually profit share with the learners. So the most learners that participate them end up actually getting, they pay out in crypto and cash and give people like actual money for participating and taking the class. And I've never heard of that before. And I think it's like one of the coolest kind of modern web three ways to incentivize the people to do the activities of learning that you're trying to get them to accomplish. What do you think of that? I think that's really neat. That's really neat. I wonder how that's working for them. Some folks are just not motivated by money, though. It's true. It's like an extrinsic motivation. And I think it's their way to teachers assistance and people that are active and community and helping others more than like, you know, like actively learning. And I think that's part of it, too. But it's like, how do you get people in the community answering and, you know, like being part of that and really helping, but then fairly compensating them, too, because that's work. Right. So that they're going for. No, I really like that. And those are the people you kind of need. You need those community members that are lending a hand and things like that. So it's really nice to recognize and compensate them a bit. For me, it's tricky, too, because I don't want to like I don't want to exploit the community. I don't want them to literally doing labor for us, a commercial business and, you know, not getting compensated for it fairly. So I thought that was just a clever way to do that and kind of help motivate people and, you know, share, share the success of the platform with the people that are using it. You built a learning platform and you had help and somebody built that platform for you or worked on. But at some point you are having to think about the platform and the delivery and the learning experience. And I'm wondering, how do you balance platform and creation and design of the delivery mechanism, co-creation of the content that people are going to interact with the courses? Yeah. Fortunately, in the beginning, we had to focus on both the platform itself, but then also we really needed to put courses out. So I kind of tag team this with another co-worker and had that co-worker focus on the platform stuff while I focused on getting the courses out. Once the platform matured, then it was less work. It was more just maintenance there. Here and there, we might have a request for a new feature or something, but most of the attention was needed on the course. What makes a really good course? We've talked about it a little bit, but just if you're going to describe the kind of what, how does it feel and what goes into a really good course? Okay. A really good course. I think one is a good needed topic, right? Two is the length of the course. So anything that's too long, I found people don't finish them. Yeah, that's true. That's true, right? They won't finish them. So you have to be mindful, even if it needs to be like a part one and a part two or something like that. But the length of that course, I found the happiest spot is about an hour. What have you found, Joel? It really kind of depends and you got to break it down and people's attention, Wayne. So if it's a live workshop, four hours, like it is really after that, like people just glaze over. And then when you're trying to get people to go through a course, I feel like, you know, you have to break it down into chunks at the end. It might be a longer course. It might be a four hour course, but let's break it down into chunks. So at each module, each hour increment, you're getting like some value and you're achieving something so that, you know, like you've achieved it. You can stop, come back later. Yeah. Yeah. And then also another element for a good course, again, is the engagement part. I think that's what really keeps them because you're not just listening. I do kind of code along style, so you can watch me if you wanted to, but I encourage people to like code with me. And then at the end, I offer an exercise of their own. So I think that really gets them bought in, you know, they've now invested, they've worked on some problems, they've solved them. They feel really good about that and they continue on. So like my, I have a Java course on Test Automation University that's about six hours long. So it's a really long course and if I look at that one compared to other ones that may be three or four hours, the completion rate is much better. And I, that definitely is attributed to the engagement factors that I've placed in there. So some of the other ones are long, but there's no exercises for folks in that. How do you balance the, as you mentioned video, and I think video is a great mechanism for delivering certain types of content, but how do you balance the text and the quizzing and that sort of thing with video and what seems to be most effective? So for accessibility reasons, I hired an editor that would, or a transcriber that would essentially take every video and it's not just the text, right? They actually make that into almost like an article. So they're incorporating like pictures from the video, the code snippets that the instructor is going over and embedding all of that right in the transcript. And I did that for accessibility reasons, but I was really surprised to see how many people were using those transcripts. So some folks were using them as opposed to the video and many people, I think it was like 60% were using it as a compliment to the video. So they would let the video play and let the instructor speak, but they were reading and following along with the transcript, which I thought was really interesting. Yeah, that's something I do. I'll watch the transcript or read the transcript while listening to it. On 2x speed too, I like to do that. I'm listening to it on double speed while I read because I find videos kind of slow sometimes. So if you read it, you feel like that's... Yeah, so I'm kind of processing it visually and then, and it depends on what the video is, right? If somebody is actively coding or they're doing something or it's something, you know, take out like a woodworking course. I can't, you can't read about woodworking. It just doesn't work. But a lot of times when it's more of a either, you know, like a knowledge work type of course, I'll be able to follow the transcript and it's honestly how I can podcast too. I pull up a transcript, I import them into Otter, pull up the transcript, listen to it on 2x and watch it run through the transcript while I watch it listen at that speed. So it's kind of engaging and gets me through it in a quicker way. Okay, I want to try that on my next, the next course I take, I'm going to try that approach. How important are completion rates in a course? Do people, is it, you know, is it really important or can people get what they need and get out? Or how do you put weight on the completion rates in a course? You know, when we first launched AU, I would get questions about, you know, from my, from folks working there. I would get questions about the completion rates and what can we do to improve completion rates? And it wasn't something that I even thought of like monitoring. I didn't really care about that. And I don't know if that's just me being naive or what. I care about, unless there's some sort of, you know, issue, oh, this is the quality of the course is not good or something like that. But other than that, I just don't think people finish things. They just don't, like, I don't finish things, right? I take courses sometimes and I got what I needed, I'm done. Or this isn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be. So I screw this topic all together kind of thing. Yeah, so I don't even, I don't put much weight on that at all. I think it's because it's like the only metric outside of following up and talking to them about their success and what the course actually did for them, which is labor intensive and difficult. So you can just take, well, we can automate this and see how many actually finished. And it's, you know, it's something to look at. It's a debated topic, actually. Do you think it's more important how many people started it or how many people finished it, or equally as important? The only real measure of success for me in any of this is whether the students achieve the difference in their lives that they're set out to achieve in the first place. And if we're accomplishing that, we're doing a good job. It's just hard to measure that unless you are really, you know, invested in their approach. And it's particularly difficult when we're talking about creating self-paced courses, you know, like an egghead course. Start and finish it. We get it. There's this cliff after the first video. I'm literally every one of them. And you can kind of see this cliff after videos one and two and people fall off. They just, you know, this wasn't for them. The instructor isn't for them. They don't like the style, whatever. And then, you know, how they go through it after that is varied. But often people just, they're trying to solve a specific problem, a technical problem. They get their answer. They get to move on in their lives and, you know, go about their job. And that's why they watched the course in the first place, because they were going to solve a very specific thing. And it either did it or it didn't. And that to me is success. And that's how I measure it or try to into my ability. I like that. Angie, thank you so much for chatting with me. It's always interesting. Where can people find out what you're up to on a regular basis? Yeah, check me out. I live on Twitter at TechGirl1908. I also have a website, AngieJones.Tech. Thanks, Angie. Yeah. Thank you, Joel.

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm really curious to talk to you about Notion Mastery and Notion in general and particularly using Notion as a course delivery platform. Like a course on Notion makes a lot of sense to me. Like Notions, you know, one, it's a blank slate so you can do whatever you want in it. So some sort of rails in which to ride on to use it as a effective platform makes a ton of sense. But a course about Notion that is delivered through Notion, that's really quite fascinating to me. First, before we dig into all that, I was wanting to ask you, how do you personally approach learning new complex topics when you sit down to learn something new? What's your general strategy or approach? If any, maybe you don't have one. It's pure chaos. I like that. Chaos and obsession. I'm like, okay, who do I know that's talking about this? What resources do I already have? What have I collected that's related to this? What books do I have? I go a little nuts, deep diving on it and just I want to consume everything all at once. I'll often hire at least a couple coaches or other people and I just immerse myself in it. And one nerdy thing I like to do is pick a couple skills to learn each quarter. So I'll be like, okay, Q1 hiring. I don't know anything about hiring and delegating and management. That's going to be my thing. And so I'm like reading all the books and just having conversations with people too. Like who knows about this stuff and what can I learn about it? So I throw myself into the deep end. Do you go to Amazon and get like all the five-star review books or do you have constraint in your library acquisitions? I actually think I lean more maybe toward personal recommendation, mastermind groups or Slack groups or whatever. I'm like who has a really good recommendation in this area or sometimes Twitter. But yeah, I'd say reaching out to people that I already know that I hold in high esteem that would have some- Somebody that's like already an expert or partially an expert or has an interest in the subject matter. I also like the idea of hiring coaches and I think people often don't consider that. We grew up with teachers, but like the idea of hiring a personal coach to more efficiently learn a new skill is really, it's been effective for me anyway, like to get over that initial what is going on in a new domain. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm a huge fan of coaches, just coaches and experts. Like I've mentioned before, I've hired an instructional designer and just people that know their stuff and can shortcut that learning big time. So I'm a huge fan of hire the experts, speed it up. What do you think makes for a good teacher? I'm sure this is going to be personal preference, but- Yeah, yeah. It is. Totally. That's fine. I think a really good teacher is someone who can create a safe space to learn where you don't feel like an idiot, even if you're learning something really complex. So do they leave room for exploration? Do they foster engagement? Do they bring something dynamic and interesting to the content? Because there's lots of people teaching the same stuff online. But I think often people's delivery style can really connect with you in a different way. And I do think there's room for a lot of different types of teachers, but I do like to think about how does that teacher show up energetically? What do they bring into the table? Are they keeping my attention? Because short attention span, especially when you've got ADHD. So I'm like, let's get to the point. Let's go. How do we keep this interesting? It's always a wave too, right? Because you have to go in depth, but also keep it interesting. So it's like the push and the pull and the cadence of a good teacher is really hard to... I think the safe space for exploration where you're almost encouraged to fail somewhat has been something I've seen important too, where it's not just lecturing you with the answers. It's like you go out there and do some stuff and figure it out also is an important part of the process. And a good teacher to me would know... Yes, getting you to think differently. Yeah, exactly. Let you make your mistakes, but then examine them and the feedback cycle and that sort of thing. Absolutely. So Notion Mastery isn't your first course online and you've been doing this for a while. What turned the corner and decide, well, this is the subject matter that I want to explore for a longer period of time when you sat down to dig into Notion? There was this guy, Joel, at this mastermind that I was at. Okay. So at the time I was already playing with Notion. I was chatting about it, talking about it. I was getting a little obsessed about it. And I think you had said, this is a lightning in a bottle moment. You need to start a YouTube channel. You need to double down on this. And I definitely experienced that tension and resistance. And I was like, do I want to be known as the Notion person? Is that my legacy? Is that where I want to go right now? And I thought, fuck it. What if I just tried it? What would I lose to just try this as a chapter? Let's double down on this for a little bit and see how it goes. And so I think part of it was your encouragement. You just said, I think there's something here. And you pointed to it and just said, do the YouTube thing. I was like, all right, screw it. I'm just going to try it. I was terrified, but I thought, what do you got to lose to just try it for a couple months anyway? So I made the commitment that I would do a YouTube video on it every week for 12 weeks. And right around the same time, I think I had just done like a one-off Notion webinar that caught Notion's attention. And so ended up partnering with them doing their office hours. And so basically for those 12 weeks, it was a live event for Notion and then a YouTube video. So I think it probably felt like my face, like I was just always out there talking about Notion. And so it didn't take very long. It was like a three-month stint that it felt like I went from being relatively quiet on the internet to like, oh yeah, you should talk to Marie. She's the Notion girl. So it took on a life of its own that I wasn't really expecting. And then it didn't take long before people were like, if you make a course on this, I'll give you money. People were actually telling me that. And I thought, okay, there's something here and there's attraction that I had never experienced before with any of my other courses. And I thought, let's just, let's see where this goes. You mentioned YouTube. And I'm really curious because I have a, I've struggled personally to ever really use YouTube in a way that made sense to me. And I'm wondering, how did you get into that? And did you have a strategy going into YouTube other than you should really post some videos on YouTube, which maybe we all should, I don't know. But how did you get over that or get into that, I should say? It was very difficult. Like definitely making, certainly editing videos was not a skillset that I have, but I had done the technical aspects. Yeah. What do I edit with? What I record with? I just, I didn't really know much about it, but I thought you just have to start somewhere. There's no way you're going to get good at something unless you try. And I had done a hundred day video challenge before that was me trying to get out of my shell a little bit and learn how do you actually edit it when you're just using your phone and you don't have any fancy equipment, like just use what you've got. So that was helpful for just getting over that initial hurdle. There is something scary, of course, when you make a piece of content, it's available for however many people and Notion's got a huge audience. So even just putting a couple of crappy videos out there, they were getting a huge amount of hits very quickly and people being like, your hair is ratty or just making, but it was like, oh, this is a whole new world. Like not everybody is nice on the internet and you're going to have to grow a little bit of a thick skin. And so I just, I can't even explain it, but I just thought it's more interesting to me if I want to make an impact and if I want to teach people, I'm going to have to get comfortable doing this. And this is going to be the best way to do it. This is where Notion users are looking for their answers. So get over yourself and put some crappy, you know, first draft videos up. And then the comments are what start feeding the ideas. Oh, how did you do X? And I was like, oh, actually, that's a really great question. Suddenly it feeds the content engine of, okay, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to need to teach this. And you can start to see how there's just so many opportunities for content creation when you just put a, you know, first couple videos out. Comment section is a double-edged sword. It sounds like there's at some point where you have to ignore the detractors and that's often easier said than done. How were you able to do that? Were you able to balance the good versus the evil nature of the comment section? Definitely. Yeah. Like I think when you start to see that you're actually helping people, to me, that feeds my soul. When I know that I've done a thing and someone's like, holy crap, thank you. You just solved the thing. I've been banging my head against the wall. That to me is very motivating and it's way more motivating to know I'm helping 10 people for every, or maybe even a hundred people for every one or two people that are like, this is too slow or too confusing or whatever it is. So you just learn the cadence and you start to learn how to approach things with a bit more polish and you just get better every single time you do a new video. How do you think the YouTube channel, are you still doing that practice? Is that something that you're still up to? I only did six videos last year. You toned it down a lot? I've toned it down mostly because I've been focused on the course and it takes a lot more time, I think, to make a polished lesson video, for example, than it is to just do a YouTube video. Maybe that's just my own issue with that, but it feels like a YouTube video needs to, I don't even know if it takes more time necessarily, but because it feels like this evergreen piece of content that gets a pretty big audience, you want it to be more polished where course videos, I can switch those up easily, but once it's out into the ether on YouTube, it's there. So I want to put more care and time and attention and make sure it's really well placed. So maybe I'm scrappier in the course than I am on YouTube. I think one of the interesting things on YouTube is to go, if you look at prolific YouTubers and trace back to what they're currently doing, where they have the, they have lighting behind them and plants and it's a nice set or however they approach it. But when you trace them back and look at their early videos and watching the progression of folks on YouTube, it's really interesting because it generally goes from that scrappy, I'm editing this on my phone into now I use Adobe Premiere and I have practical lighting and set design and that sort of thing. I think it's fascinating to look at that progression. I'm also curious, with YouTube and the course, how did that practice or the content even that you're making feed or fuel the course? Was it almost beta or research for the, what eventually became the course or is there less of a distinct relationship? I think I started the YouTube stuff in late August and I think I had launched the pilot of my course by late October and I didn't have, I didn't have course content ready, but I said, Hey, I'm going to make a course on this. We're going to do live calls every week. If you're interested, join here. And I pre-sold it. So I didn't, and I was very honest about the fact that I didn't have content created, but you were going to co-create this with me. Like I'm going to build it based on your needs when you show up in the calls. I'm a big fan of doing live first, then you turn into the polish lesson. So any chance where you get to interact with people and just see where that confusion is, I think is incredible. So I'm a big fan of doing those pilot live, like workshop something first, do a webinar first, and then you can go feed it into the course and polish it. I think I was probably getting most of my traction, maybe on Twitter, definitely a little bit of YouTube. And then by the time I launched the course, it made about 10,000 in the first week of not having a very big audience. Just like, Hey, if I made this course, would you be interested? So when it sold with no email funnel, no, like hardly anything, I thought, okay, there's something here. If with very little effort, I was able to make $10,000. Okay. What, what if I took this a little bit more seriously? And so it took, I'd say probably took five months to go from complete beta non-existent course to like having a course that I could remove beta from and actually sell it. So it definitely took some time. And the whole while I'm still making YouTube videos too. So the YouTube videos and comments were feeding into the course and stuff like that. But when I look at my intake form of people joining the course, it was like 80% found me through YouTube. So it was definitely a huge driver to the core sales for sure. Yeah, that makes sense. So how did you launch the first course? You did the workshops and I'm assuming that was, I don't know if that was webinars or how did you sell tickets and how did you get people actually to come and show up? What's your approach for that? Cause I think people use different systems for that sort of thing from just PayPal me or, you know, like Venmo me the cash or, you know, are you using a platform to achieve that? Or what were you using? The first time was just Gumroad. It was just a, yeah, it was just a Gumroad payment checkout here. And then I invited them manually into my Notion workspace, into my own like personal Notion workspace, which is hilarious looking back. And I think we did that for the first hundred people. And I was like, okay, this is not sustainable. Like I'm literally manually inviting people in. And so it would be like, hold on, you know, like you sort of feel like you're always on call with your notifications. It's not really a great user experience. It was fine for the beginning while I was just testing the waters. I was like, okay, we need to figure out a way to better automate this and moved over to Thrivecart and then got an enterprise account with Notion, which allowed me to be able to give people a team login code. So they actually become a member of the space as soon as they click on that link. So that was one of the technical moves that we made to make that process a little bit easier. But there was no launching or there was no formal strategy. There was no like funnel or anything like that. Just in time finding what you need and applying it based on maybe recommendations or just even looking around. I did that recently and just asked what people would use. And we're using Tally for forms now. Your recommendation. And I think that's a great way to do it because it feels, I don't know, especially with a new product, if you aren't launching products on a monthly or semi-annual basis, which I don't think most of us generally are, like there's always something new, right? Like the state of the art is always different. So you have people and they're coming into your Notion space and it's your personal Notion space. This is where your journals are. And, you know, like I've seen you use Notion in a very kind of robust way that I think is interesting. Yeah. There was like a course page that lived in my space. And so suddenly, even when you're adding names to other pages on your space, every possible guest comes up. So I was like, OK, this is a bit untenable to have these folks in my personal space. So we definitely had to make the move and get an official Notion space that was an enterprise account that's separate from my own personal business account and had to switch that over. So there were, I mean, anyone who joined in the beginning has probably seen a hilarious number of iterations where it's like, oh, now we're on this thing. Oh, now they're using Tally. Oh, now they do feedback forms every week. Oh, now they're doing live workshops. Like we've definitely continued to evolve it. And I have to say it doesn't really feel like, oh, there was like a point, like course is finished and now we're moving on to next phase. I think I can't help myself. Like I want to make it better. So we're always revamping. I'm sure for some people that probably feels quite frustrating. They're like, oh, like it's never the same when I log in. But that's the nature of the beast with also Notion changes their features really frequently. And it just kind of is what it is. So we're always trying to figure out, like, how can we make this process smoother for people to move through it and get what they need? So I think it's interesting that you use the enterprise approach versus like something like member spaces. I think that is it member spaces or other approaches. And what was the was it cost or features or what had you think about Notion enterprise in terms of the approach? I mean, one as an ambassador that does a lot of, you know, events for Notion and that sort of thing, it doesn't cost me anything to have an enterprise account where it would like most, it's not really tenable. I think for most people to actually run an enterprise. It's not too bad, 240 a year or something. So if you're priced accordingly, I think you could probably pull it off. But it's per member. Remember, but if your course was priced, you know, I was wondering, actually, I was curious mostly because I, you know, you charge $750 for your course. And if you're paying $250 per seat, and that would be, you know, cost prohibitive, but as a perk of your ambassadorship, they allow that. And I think that's fantastic. And one, you know, you're out there really doing a lot of work for them. So it's well-deserved. Yeah, it's not like some sort of special, it's like you're actually out there working and spreading the word about their product. So that's a good business sense on their part too. But yeah, in terms of choosing that, I think partly it was if I'm teaching a course about mastering Notion, I want to show, I want the actual experience of taking the course to be part of the education itself to see, oh, shit, I didn't know you could do that with Notion. Oh, whoa, that's interesting. I thought, actually, how far can I push the platform in terms of what can we do in terms of online teaching and having a forum, like we used to have a forum that was actually built in Notion before we moved to Circle. So there's things like that, that, okay, what is Notion good at? Where is it limited that, you know, it evolves over time. But I think it's just a really interesting, there's no difference in the interface between an admin and a student. Like we're all looking at the same page. I think that makes content updates really easy. The linking system, just being able to mention other things really easily. It's easier to manage than a tool like MemberSpace, for example, with just the sheer scale of lessons and content and resources that we have. With MemberSpace, there was an element of locking and setting up links that was just that extra beat. It just took a lot more time to set these kinds of things up. We still have lots of clients that use MemberSpace for smaller resource libraries and things like that. I think it's really great. But I just really wanted to see if people actually taking the course could be a little surprised at how easy or how beautiful it could be to create these interesting experiences. I think it's also really cool because I think one of the challenges in teaching anything is the separation of the educational material with the environment in which you learn, right? Even where you have to have stuff on one monitor and another, where if you're learning Notion in Notion, it's like there's this practical aspect of being able to be right in the environment where you're learning about the environment that you're currently learning about. I'm a big fan of metaspirals. I love things that eat themselves. That's pretty fantastic. Yeah. And one of the weird things too we had to figure out was, well, they're reading about it and learning about it, but then they also have their own workspace. And so one of the things we did in the new version too is encourage people to have those new windows. Have your own Notion workspace open in one window, have the other space open here. It's how to switch quickly between the two and just encouraging people to build along as they're watching. So don't just watch passively, actually have your own workspace open and make some time for it. Yeah, there's all sorts of quirks about it, but I do think it's just an interesting approach, I think. I think there's other people doing courses on Notion. I don't think most of them are actually hosted in Notion. So I think that's interesting. Yeah. I've only seen a couple of different courses, period, that are hosted in Notion, whether they're about Notion or not. And Shift Nudge, I don't know if you've ever seen that. Matt D. Smith, he does his in Notion. And that was the first time I personally experienced it. And I was like, this is really fantastic, actually. It just removes a bunch of technical hassle with the delivery platform for a course. And I don't know that it's appropriate for everything. And it does lack features, like you mentioned, you end up needing to go to Circle, the community platform for forums or whatever, for that sort of communication. And it's interesting to me, because in the past, you've participated in and built and ran a company that was a learning platform, right? Yes. Been there, done that. Yeah. What's a good reason to build your own bespoke, full stack course delivery platform, if there is one? I don't think that was really your goal, because you did not build that platform necessarily to deliver your own courses. Is that correct? Yeah. It was to help us with client work, because most of our clients were people that were running platforms, and none of the platforms were meeting the needs at the time. I think so many other platforms have come out even since we first launched Okie back in the day. But at some point, I think we realized, one, that, oh my gosh, the customer support for a $29 a month product is infinitely bigger than for a $1,000 training program. It's just such a different experience as a creator. I don't know how Ben handled those customer support, just people being rude, where it can be an error on their end. We're like, my Zapier is not working. I hate you. This company is terrible. And I'm like, for $29, my little heart can't take it. It's pretty good. I was like, your whole business runs on this platform, and it's making you money. And so anyway, there were parts of that, just it wasn't super fulfilling to be on the software side of it. I'm sure there's lots of reasons why it would be a really great idea. And if you're building it to deliver your own custom materials, and that was your primary motivation, because you're like, none of the platforms out there are solving this unique need that I have, great. But I think I'm not a programmer, so I don't have the skill set to be like, oh, it's worth doing that build. But I saw the time and effort and energy that goes into that, building it, maintaining it. And it's hard for me to justify that it would be worth customizing your own, unless your company is a training company. I could see if that's a core piece of what you deliver, then maybe that makes sense. But it's a lot of work. I've spent almost a decade on a course delivery platform as my primary job. And I'm always like, people, I want to build my own platform. And I'm like, if you really want to, I think that's a great thing, and you should pursue that. But maybe just make sure that's something you really want to do, because it's often easier to let... Yeah, it's often easier just to use a service, right? Which is why they exist. Though I can understand also why people wouldn't be satisfied with the current one. And I think that's what you did is more, it's more bespoke too, because you're taking things that exist and combining them in new and interesting ways. And then, you know, like dealing with the access and that kind of stuff. So there's like, you lose some of the bespokeness of it, but it's a constraint at the end of the day for the design of your community and through delivery and all that fun stuff. Probably not the most important. I don't know. It's all important at the end of the day. In the beginning, you were the instructional designer, just the designer in chief of all the things, wearing all the different hats for how you approach that. And how has that contrasted? Because now you collaborate with instructional designers and have built a team versus that solo thing that you were doing up front. How has that changed how you think about motion mastery? I'm so grateful for my team. Yeah, I've been working by myself for 10 years. I've been a, you know, sole proprietor mostly, even when Ben and I work together, we're pretty much working on our own projects. We're very independent people with our own creative whims and just, where does my energy today take me? And it was very chaotic and creative and amazing, but then key things don't get done or, you know, balls get dropped and that sort of thing. So I'm not the details person. I know I'm more the creative, the visionary. So I knew like ops was somebody, like I needed an operations person as my first hire for sure. And so even in that first selling the course, I think I hired Georgia pretty quickly on contract to help me because I'm like, oh, I need someone who can invite the guests in manually. And there was just all these moving parts and pieces. And I very quickly saw, okay, I'm able to get by with this right now, but this is not going to be scalable for me. There's just no way. And the part that's fun, of course, is making the notion content or like showing people what's possible. But if I'm busy, you know, answering customer support and just connecting up zaps and like that, you know, that's your soul leaving your body there to have Georgia on hand and for her to handle stuff so much more quickly. I can't even describe the relief that I felt when even just bringing her on part time. And so I think it took us maybe a year of working together on contract. And every month, I was like, how about more hours? How about more? Would you give up your other clients and just getting more and more of her time and building more trust? And just last year, it's been, I think it's been almost exactly a year that George has been my full-time ops person. You know, she's the ops person for okie dokie, but really the majority of her work and time spent is notion mastery related stuff. So it's really around our signature product. And then husband left his full-time job just a month or two ago. And so he's back at the company. And then just today, we hired our first, I guess we're calling her our chief learning officer. So she's going to be responsible for designing trainings. So it's, it's definitely evolved over time as we're just noticing the needs as, okay, what, where are these sticky points? Like, where am I feeling really stressed or where, what's fun? What's not fun. And I think it's been a big priority of our tiny little company that everybody is working with their best skillset. Like the stuff that Georgia loves doing, she gets to do and can't believe she's getting paid for it. And same here. I'm like, I can't believe I got to make content about this and get to connect with these incredible people around the world. This is a ridiculous job. I can't believe I made this job for myself. That's how I want it to feel or optimize for. Of course, there's always going to be stuff that we don't want to do. But so in figuring that out, it was like looking at the stuff that where am I dragging my feet? Where am I resisting stuff? Like what's being difficult. And in the redesign of the course and knowing that there were gaps and I was leaving people behind, it was going too fast or, you know, moving too quickly. I was like, I'm actually not the best person to teach beginners. Like I'm so advanced. I love pushing the boundaries of it that it's really hard to be like, click here to add a new entry to like, this is not, and I'm a very patient person and I love helping people. But I knew that in the material I was just leaving so many of those gaps. And so whenever I just noticed there's a gap where I'm like, this is not excellent. I know that I'm leaving people in the dust. I sort of figure out who do I need to hire to get that help with? And that's where I was like, okay, this has been too difficult to put what feels like this massive nebulous, so many moving parts, so many pieces of content. How do you distill this down into a course when, you know, you're going to have teams of 10 joining one person that's like a lawyer, like literally people from all over the world, every background and every intention. Do I need to niche more? Like there were lots of questions. I'm like, how do I?\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I distill this down into something that's digestible. So working with an instructional designer, the first thing they do is they force you to get back to, who is your idol student? Who's the best person? Who's the dumbest? Yeah, they start asking that question. Right? It's like every time, you always go back to, who is the person that you're trying to serve? And that is still difficult because there are so many different people and ages, and I love that. But interesting patterns emerge, and you start to develop for those patterns. And even noticing there's a gigantic percentage of people with ADHD in the course. I was like, oh, that's funny. So many people in the course of ADHD. I didn't know I had ADHD at the time, but I was like, oh, that actually makes a lot of sense because people are watching my YouTube videos and being like, she thinks the way I do. So that was a really interesting insight. And being aware of that then allows me to fill those gaps and say, okay, what if I brought in Kat, who has a background in adult learning, to actually deliver the beginner office hours? Then she can, she just knows better how to meet someone at that beginner level and can pace herself in a way that is a little less chaotic. It's been a process to figure out who are the best people to make this up, but night and day, there's no way I would have been able to triple our revenue as soon as you bring on one team member. Okay, wow, what a difference it makes when I have someone handling ops and it's not up to me. I'm not that person. That's not where I should be spending my energy. You mentioned that you took a quarter off, or one of your learning goals for a quarter was hiring. And I think that's interesting because hiring is a challenge and it's something that when you don't get it right, can be like a huge crush on you and then you're affecting people's lives. And how do you approach hiring and finding people to fill these gaps in your process? This is such an interesting question because I don't, even though I learn about this stuff and there's all of the rules that you should follow around it or best practices, I know at the end of the day, I still go rogue and I, this person just feels energetically like I really like them. Yeah, like I just, I, when I connect deeply with someone and I see a skillset and I do think that's what, that is a strength of mine is seeing other people's gifts and seeing where we can plug in and where there's potential. What I know now is I need to vet that by Ben. I need to vet that by Georgia. It needs to be a team decision now. It's not just like Marie impulsively has fallen in love with this person because I always fall in love with people and I just want to bring them in and be their best friends. And you know, that's my tendency. I need to take a beat, hold on a second. Let's vet this person and make sure, do we have enough work for this person? You know, can we make a role for them? So usually I start with the person first, but there are of course, Oh, marketing is a gap right now. So I'm keeping my eyes peeled for someone that could fill that gap for me. So it's a combination of just who in my network is showing up or who in the course is shining as this amazing contributor. And I'm like, Ooh, like Kat has a way with the way she speaks, just participating on office hours. I was like, I want to collaborate with her. So Kat was hired directly from as a student to a collaborator. I think that's wonderful. That's one of my favorite ways to see somebody that's actively doing the thing that you need and then to lift them into the role. And she shared a course of hers in the forum. It was called elevate your online presentations or something like that. So how to be more engaging on zoom, how to present, how to speak. And I was like, Oh, this woman, whenever she speaks, there's so much clarity. She doesn't use filler words. She just has a way and a confidence on camera that I was like, I don't know. Could I like take some of that from you? It's amazing the way that you, that she shows up. And I thought, I want Notion Mastery training and even our videos to have that level of quality. What could that look like if I brought her into co-deliver training or to even just actually deliver training on my behalf? Maybe I don't even need to be there for all of those trainings. What would that look like? So just keeping an open mind and just tuning into where have I been wanting to up the quality? Okay. I see somebody showing up in that way. Let's bring them into the fold. Let's collaborate first and then slowly harass them continuously until they agree to take on a full-time job. I followed that playbook in the past, actually. I think it's a pretty good way. I agree. And like now when I can ask somebody and bring other people in, because I get very enthusiastic very quickly and I know in my heart that sometimes my enthusiasm wanes also. So like I have to balance that and having like other trusted collaborators that you can go to and get feedback and curb your enthusiasm a bit. Which sucks because you're like, no, you don't understand. This is the most exciting thing. And they're like, hold on, simmer down. It's difficult. Yeah. Hiring people can't be a hobby. I think that's the key takeaway for me is that you can't, that isn't a hobby, you're affecting other people. So it's unlike other things that you do, it's something that you have to take back a little bit. Well, can I ask you based on, there's obviously been some similarity in our experience there, but are there some takeaways that you've learned? Okay. Now I know this about hiring. Is this something that I always do every time? Or are there any sort of just general lessons learned that you. The bigger the ambition, the harder it is and the harder it is. It's like anything, right? Like it's like this iterative approach. And if we don't take the contract to hire approach where we work together for a period of time and make sure that it works, it almost has never worked out. Everything that's worked out best for me has been like, okay, let's do this project. It's going to be fairly small scale. And lately my, for the last couple of years, it's the, I pay people to do discovery engagements, which is if you're a consultant, it's recommended that you do pay discovery engagements. And I've taken like full classes on how to convince your clients to pay you for discovery engagements. And I take the opposite approach. I'm like, if that's a good idea on that side, like it's probably a good idea just to pay people to do discovery engagements. So I will literally hire them and pay their consulting rate to come in and do hourly stuff and see how that works out. And then at the end of that, we get a deliverable. So whatever, whatever that is, their best suggestions and the, you know, or, you know, we fix things along the way. And if that works out, then let's do this. And if it doesn't, it's like nobody, nobody loses, like you haven't, if it just doesn't work out or you just quietly part ways, which has happened more than a few times, that's fine. It's not a bad outcome. And there's no major trauma in anybody's life when we do it that way. And everybody gets paid and you know, we get to collaborate for a period of time. And I like that. Otherwise, I kind of also, cause I've gone up and down in the amount of folks that we are collaborating with and trying to find the equilibrium. And it's like you said, can do, is there enough work? Is there enough of this kind of work? Can they actually be happy here? Can we support them? You know, when you're talking about a long-term collaborator, it really gets more, more complex, I think too. So that's been a challenge for sure. Is Notion Mastery going to be like your flagship going forward, or do you have plans to break that down? Cause you talked about niching and I'm wondering, you know, like at what points, here's the course that's the, and you know, and this isn't a drag on you, but often mastering is in a course title and it's, what does that actually mean to do that? And then the niches are different, there's different verticals and domains and different skill levels. And are you going to divide that up as multiple products or even expand outside of Notion for yourself and what you teach? There will probably be, like Ben, for example, is working on more of the team-based content because just inherently using Notion as a team versus using it as a small business where your whole life and business is integrated are very different use cases, even from first principles. Like how would you set up your databases and that sort of thing. So we are definitely in the process of separating that out a little bit and figuring out what is Notion for teams or Notion at work, what does that look like? And then Kat is probably going to be developing our train the trainer programs. How do we actually make people who can go to a company and train a company together? Because we work together, I'm sure you can probably get this. We've had people hire us to build their spaces for them. And it's very difficult to get buy-in if we do the build. So if the person is not participating in the build, they get freaked out and their team members are afraid to break stuff and they just don't use it or they use it wrong or they don't watch the train. It's a heavy lift to get a full team on board unless those members are all super excited and stoked. If they're getting dragged in to learn this new thing, they're like, why wouldn't we just use Google Docs? It's really hard to get buy-in. So what we're finding or what our sort of strong opinion is, do not outsource your build, get someone internally or get a trainer to actually take the time to train up your team. This is a process. It shouldn't be just a weekend thing and you set up your space and you're good to go. It's a process to get your team onto Notion and using it really effectively. So there's a big opportunity there too that we're like, okay, what could that look like? I think the team dynamics, almost everything we do lately is like, how does this affect teams? I think most of us are trying to work on teams and one way or the other, and there's exceptions to that. But I think we're, you know, we're in a very team oriented society as far as our work goes. And you're so absolutely right. Like the CEO edict, okay, we're using Notion now, stop using Google Docs, get into Notion on Monday. Marie set it up for you. So just use it. Okay. That doesn't work. Nobody will do that. It lasts a week and then they're back in Google Docs or wherever. And there's no, so important at a, at a organizational level to get in like the grassroots campaign. What's in it for you? Like, why should I bother? What is this? You know, Google Docs works fine. Here's how we can set up your space. Here's how we can set up your workflows and like identifying the kind of same workflows that work for everybody and how they communicate and that kind of thing is, that's huge. And frankly, I think a lot of modern knowledge management is always, it's always framed in the person. And there's this organizational knowledge management and there's probably been a lot of, and that's why we have so many bad products. There's Microsoft Teams and JIRA and you know, like the full Atlassian suite and Salesforce and all these kinds of tools that are built at these monstrous tools for orgs that are like everything for everybody all the time kind of situation. I don't know. I think there's something better for teams out there. I think Notion actually works really great for us as a team. So that makes sense to me. Yeah. I was always impressed by your sort of shared, like how transparent you were with the team and it sort of felt like you guys were growing this shared knowledge hub together and I thought it was more transparent that I think a lot of companies are willing to be for some reason. Like keeping stuff stashed. Yeah. Yeah. Or locked. Yeah. God forbid that our other team members have access to those notes or something like that. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I don't even have any personal, everything I have is pretty much open to like my team. I don't open it to the world, but I'll open it to my team, like that sort of situation. So how has the actual people taking your course affected the course over time? How have they driven change and feedback from them? It sounds like a lot considering you're hiring folks out of your course to actually help continue the course. But yeah. Yeah. And I've hired, you know, three, four people in different ways, contract and otherwise for sure. So I've had people go in and edit, I've had people come up with solve ideas and stuff like that. So hugely for sure. And I think part of that is partly being a people pleaser, maybe a bit of perfectionist, just like I'm a quick start. Like I launched stuff really quickly, but I also do have this, I do want this to be a super high quality product. I care because also when you have 1700 people in there, like that's the biggest product I like biggest audience I've had for a product that I've made in terms of, you know, online courses and stuff to some people, it might not be that big a deal, but I'm like, holy crap, that's 1700 people that paid me that money for that. I need to show up. I need to make sure that they feel like they got what they paid for. And so it really matters to me. So people are stuck and they're filling out stuff that says, Hey, I was really confused by X or, you know, I feel like this was missing X. I'm like, Ooh, okay. Better go back and either add that or rethink that. And that's really important to me. So getting good at accepting feedback, I think when you're a teacher and getting good, getting good at discerning, is this just this one person's weird edge case, or is this actually a problem on a bigger scale? Because not everybody that has a problem with your content is telling you as well. So discerning that as a whole process too, and then how do you incentivize people to give you feedback and not just, Oh, be disappointed and then peace out. It really does matter to us. So in the beginning, I didn't have any follow-up sequences through email. There was nothing that was sort of systemized in that way to collect that feedback. So it took a while to get all the processes in place. And that's what having Georgia, you know, my ops person in place to do that was huge. So now we have even just a simple check-in form, I think that goes out after six weeks. That's, Hey, what's challenging you with the course right now? How can we make your experience better? Anything goes. And then what's a win that you had this week? It doesn't even have to be course related. Just how can we celebrate with you? And strangely enough, those simple questions have been a gold mine for even just, Oh, okay. Ideas for improving content, realizing where there's gaps and that sort of thing. So that's, it's super important to me that the course does deliver on its promise and that it feels like an industry standard course. I don't think it's there yet, but that's where I want to move with it and make it freaking excellent. My last question is pricing and what's your decision making in terms of pricing. And I think one of the interesting things with the, your, your course pricing is when it's priced, I think you've, you know, it's not inexpensive and it's not cost prohibitive and it really depends on how you're using it, if it's worth it to you. So I think that that pricing gives a good amount of buy-in, but then you also don't make a, it's not like a buy once, get it forever. And then it's also not a subscription, which I thought was interesting. And I don't think I've seen that happen a lot where it's like a non-recurring annual fee to participate. Well, I think part of that too, is the course still feels like it's in progress. Like we're still evolving and iterating on this new version. So we've never actually expired anyone. So even though it's like, buy the course, get it for 12 months, we've actually never kicked anybody out. So anyone who even signed up two years ago still has access to all the new materials. And some of the early people wouldn't have even had office hours. So the fact that, you know, some people would have paid 300 bucks for the course and two years later, I think we did 128 live events last year. So even though it's technically a self-study, there are so many different live events that we put on to make sure that people can get what they need. So in the beginning, it was what, 297? I didn't know, just threw a random number out there. I'm like, are people willing to pay this? And I think after a hundred people, I was like, okay, let's increase it to 300. Okay. It didn't, there was no change in people signing up. Okay. Let's add another a hundred bucks. No change at all in the number of people that were signing up. I thought, okay, it was clearly underpriced at some point. And we're also making improvements, right? So to me, it's, you know, certainly an art to know how to price things and even comparing to similar quality of courses, you know, what is another X number of sessions and the type of delivery model and just sort of comparing what are people used to paying in these different industries for software, that sort of thing. It feels like a intuitive, chaotic guess. I've had people tell me I can't afford this. It's way too overpriced. And I've had people be like, this is ridiculous value. And you definitely need to increase the price, you know, to some people it's going to be underpriced to some people it's not quite there. So I'm sure once the new curriculum is finished, we'll probably change up our pricing model again. It's always a good time to reevaluate too. When you have a major update and see what the, what the market will bear. I also think that there's the idea that you can provide discounts. You can always provide discounts, but it's hard to charge people more. You know what I mean? If you have a course and it's X dollars, you can't be like, well, for you, it's going to be several hundred dollars more than that. Where the other way is, is people will generally appreciate it. And you can have systems like we do purchase power parody to where yeah. Parody bar. Yeah. We're, you know, globally we know we don't use anything sensible like parody bar. We built a bespoke system just for us. I don't think parody bar existed when we made it, but it's great. Like it just picks up where you are and gives you a discount based on global purchasing power. And I think that kind of thing is great. And you know, like student programs and all that, and you can always do that, but we've tried, you know, if you're an enterprise, we're going to charge you more. And, you know, if you want team features to then, and I've seen that around and I've never been very happy with it. Pricing is very difficult. It's, I like that you brought up the parody thing too, because I've always sort of had this charge enough to be generous. Being generous is an important part. Like I love being able to, for someone who's been saving for a while and, you know, sends a really lovely reply to an email newsletter. I've been like, Hey, I know that you've been, this is, you've had your eye on it and money's tight and here's, here's a copy of the course or whatever. Like I've definitely given the course out for free to people or to, you know, giving out scholarships and parody pricing. So that's important, but that also means we still need to keep the lights on and pay the team. So finding that balance that you can build that generosity into your pricing, I think is pretty, pretty cool. Yeah, definitely. Marie, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I appreciate your course on a material level because it's helped us. And we, like as an organization have been using it to just go up our own game. And so that's a lot of fun. And I know it's helping a lot of people manage the chaos that our lives are in this digital age. I appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you so much for, for hanging out and chatting with me. Thank you for great questions. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"You've been an inspiration for us with our own platform, and you've built multiple course platforms and deliver really high-quality learning materials to folks. I wanted to kind of kick it off and ask you, how do you approach learning a new complex topic? When you sit down to learn something new, what is your system or approach to learning something complex? OK, first of all, thanks for inviting me here. And this really means a lot to me, because I had fun for years now, and that's pretty cool. So in answering your question, the framework around learning, it's so vast, and it's such a great question, such a great topic to discuss. And for me, it's a bit funny, but it's changing throughout the years, probably. The more I learn about learning, the more I feel that I know. And obviously, there are so many different ways to approach different learning topics and schemes. And this also depends on the topic that you are learning, actually. How I finished, I've enrolled for a blockchain course on Oxford University. This is like an online course with a lot of materials, like maybe 700 to 800 pages of materials. And I finished that in two weeks. So how did I accomplish this? I tried a technique with really fast scanning through the material. So basically, I was scanning 30 pages in five minutes and trying to get the grasp of what are the most important bullet points and things in the material. And then I tried to rewrite it in my own words what I've learned in these five minutes, like scanning really quickly through the material. And I discovered that, for example, this way of learning for me was exceptionally good for this kind of material, where I was like, I kind of knew something about blockchain already, but I wanted to have the systematic approach to learning. And that's why I enrolled. But I figured that quickly scanning through the material, through the text, then putting down some notes, and then discovering what I already know, it just enabled me to basically focus on the things that I don't know that I need to read through carefully later on. So for example, this is my discovery of last month. And it's really amazing how much you can learn about learning when you try and experiment different techniques. And there's a lot of it. I've explored a lot of neurobiology, how it works, how brain works, how you acquire information. And then I tried to test out different solutions. Why I'm saying about this? Because it's a fairly new technique for me. I've never learned this way. I've never approached the material this way. And now I tried. And I was able to maybe do 600 or 700 pages of blockchain material in two or three weeks. And this is simply because of that technique. And the takeaway from here is that there is no one great way to learn. And there are multiple ways to learn, depending on the context, on the material that you're trying to learn, whether you have some basic knowledge of that or not. And yeah, I think that there are many different ways. I mean, I agree. And I love the idea of running experiments with yourself. So you can sit down and try something new or try a new technique. And one thing I'm curious, because blockchain is a vast technical landscape. So you're reading, and you're going through 700 pages of material, and you're taking notes. What's the goal at the end? Or what's the next step after you've consumed this information? I would assume that that approach gives you contextual knowledge and syntactical knowledge, so you understand the vocabulary of the space and understand what you want to do next. So where do you take that? And what's next to, say, implement it, right? How do you transfer that to some sort of project that you're actually working on? Yeah, so I always try to approach a topic with a certain goal in mind. So in this particular case, I enrolled to this blockchain boot camp, or how they say, the program, because I already knew what I want to accomplish at the end. And if I don't know this, I try to figure it out at the beginning. So the enrollment itself, I don't use a lot of courses myself nowadays. I used to do a lot of them, but now it's really, I just digest some random pieces of content. I try to organize them in a scheme. And this is how I learn now, because I have the background. But in this particular case, what I try to accomplish is what I can do in two or three weeks in order to do this and that. And those were really practical things of blockchain. I wanted to create, to learn and create my NFT. I wanted to create my first smart contract. And I wanted to learn about the space, the legal aspects of the space, and running a startup in blockchain. So basically, I put down those three goals. And with these goals in mind, I basically started scraping all the material. But I was doing this quick reviews of the material. And then I was questioning myself whether I understand it. I wrote some bullet points and what I need to expand on. And then I also took some other resources, obviously, not only the material that I had, but I tried to learn as much as I can about the topic that I don't understand. So if I scrolled those 30 pages and discovered that, OK, maybe the minting process of NFTs is something that I don't really understand right now, where I can find more information. And I jump into some rabbit holes of internet learning about Web3 and just reading, but reading about this particular context so that I can rest assured that, OK, I know this part of material well. And I always try to, it's always better to just understand than read and memorize. Obviously, everyone knows that. But it's funny how people, even knowing that, they don't apply it. And the application is pretty simple. You just scan through material, or you read something. And then you ask yourself some questions, or you try to explain this to some other person. This is also one of the best ways to learn, is basically to teach what you are learning. And that's why I love teaching so much as well, because you can learn a lot if you are about to teach someone something. This is a great way to basically learn, and not only to learn, to memorize, but to understand. This is pretty great. I've recently spoke to a guy from Google. And I always ask, I'm really curious about how people learn, how they approach that in the work environment. And I was asking him about how do they have any specific things that are for employee paths for learning, acquiring new skills, and stuff like that. So he mentioned something that's pretty cool. I don't know if it's organization-wide or if it's only for their office. But what they were doing is they could learn for some part of the week, maybe a few hours or maybe more during their work week. But if they were about to learn something, the first thing that they had to do is put in the calendar, let's say in a month, a meeting or a webinar or something for other employees to teach them this particular skill that they learned. So that they had the goal, and they knew that they have to just acquire this skill in a month because there is a meeting coming up or a training that they have to perform. And they basically taught other people the things that they've learned. And I think it's brilliant. It's one of the best ways of learning. You have some goals. You have to understand material correctly in order to teach someone this material. So basically, you won't skip the information that you don't understand. You will try to learn as hard and understand all the topics so that you basically can teach some other people this topic in a month or something like that. This is pretty efficient. I think it's interesting because you mentioned having a goal. And you have a goal when you sit down to learn. And just being curious is a goal, but it's not a very strong goal. So if you're curious and you need a stronger goal, then setting that calendar date would give you a very strong goal for understanding the material truly so you could transfer it to other people, which is a pretty good hack, I think. Yeah, I always do it. It's really important for me. I don't like learning just to gather some random information. If you have a goal in place, if my goal was creating my first smart contract, then you can orient yourself towards this goal, running through all the materials that you have. And that was a pretty great experience for me, this learning session. To be honest, it was probably the first one for a few months that I had. But I wanted to dig as deep as possible and explore the space. And I just booked my time by buying this course, pretty expensive course. So basically, this was my commitment to doing that, because I wanted to do it for at least a year. But I didn't have enough motivation. I read some random information. And then I decided, OK, I need to focus on this very exact topic. I need to write down my goals. And I need to have some kind of commitment. So I basically bought the course and decided that during the period of this course, it was like maybe six weeks. But I only had three weeks to commit to that. I will do everything to learn as much as possible in order to complete and achieve my goal. And it worked out. So you described it as a text course where there's 700 or 800 pages of text that you're reading and scanning. And we both generally produce video courses. And I think that's an interesting, I don't know, phenomenon maybe, where I'm a reader. That's how I generally approach learning is written words. But do you use video courses in your own learning? Is that something? You said you don't take many courses these days. But is video part of your learning process? Yeah, not these days. Not that much. I guess that video is really great for people, more for beginners and people who are willing to basically learn some complex skill using a course, like this organized in lessons. From Eckerd, I've been learning quite a lot the other way. I mean, I had some background in programming as well. So Eckerd is great in a way that I can approach a little bits and pieces of material. And I can have the exact information that I want. And it's more advanced. So it's great. And I've been using this a lot. But the typical approach to courses is you imagine the topic. And then you learn it through 20 or 30 lessons. And this is just not the way it works for me right now. Because I feel that if you have some vast background of information, it's better for you to just read and explore the written information. But oftentimes, I scan through the transcripts of the courses. And it's like reading the video. And it allows to search as well. So it's a great way to find information too. Yeah, I end up in the transcript a lot myself and just kind of scan through it and pick and pull. And I've gotten to the point where I will download MP3s of podcasts and import them into Otter.ai, get the transcript, and then just go through and look at the guests' commentary. Because typically, the host doesn't add a lot for me. And I'm looking to see what the guest has to say. I don't know. I'm a big text-based learner. That's just how I process information quickly, I think. It's efficient for me, I think, is what it really boils down to. Yeah, I think it's, like I mentioned, the way you are learning, it changes through time. Once you have some background knowledge, quite good knowledge of technology in general, for example, then it's so much easier to find the resources that you want. You always know. Because for some people, and this is pretty difficult when you have this knowledge, to go down to the level of people who are just starting out. And this is also the thing that we struggle with trying to create courses for beginners. Because you never know where the line is, what should you explain, and what should you explain in detail. But the fact is that oftentimes, they don't know what to put in Google Search. And you already know it. You know the basics. You know the more advanced stuff. And you just figure out the words, the phrasing that should be put in the search engine. And people who are just at the beginning of their way, they don't know. And they have to learn it. And learning from the video course is a great way to do it. When you hear the words, you memorize them also. Yeah, you can then go to switch to text-based once you get some initial skills. I think it's the difference between known unknowns and unknown unknowns, right? Like, if you know what you don't know is one thing. And you can research that. If you don't even know what you don't know, then how are you going to even start? So you have to have some place where you start. And that's the challenge. Yeah, that's it. What are some qualities of a really good course in general for you? That's a great question as well. I got to ask this question myself a lot during recent years, because I'm obsessed about the course experience in general. But also, I'm a true believer in that courses and online learning can be better than, in many cases, than classroom learning. And we are not there yet. I mean, no one just, you know, I feel that sometimes I get the feeling that half or most of the internet is doing it wrong. And they are just focusing on selling the courses, not actually teaching people stuff. And marketing, right? Like, it's marketing and launching the course more than designing a learning experience that is effective. I feel like I see that a lot too. That's a phenomenon. Yeah, and this is really bad. I mean, this is something that's probably, you know, people are not, they basically learn how to market the courses. When someone is teaching people how to make your own course and stuff like that, most of this is marketing. And once you have the initial traction with your marketing and maybe you pre-sale, make a pre-sale of the course and you figure out that this might be, you know, this might be OK to do it, then you do the course. But the most, the biggest approach is on marketing. And this is pretty sad. And the way I would discover, you know, throughout, I'm doing courses for 15 years now. And I believe I've been in many places where people were pointing me in the right direction, what they expect from the course and what makes a great course. There's obviously no one answer, one great answer, because this depends on many factors. And obviously, who is the author of the course and who you're doing the course for. But sometimes if you think of some general things that make the course the best in class, like the one that I like to take as a student, I think that would be the engagement of the author. It always makes the biggest difference. When the author is engaged in the course creation process and he firmly believes that he has the knowledge that he is willing to learn on how to pass to his audience, not only, you know, randomly putting lessons of his imagination. Basically, the engagement and the energy that the author has is really crucial. And it's the most important factor because I've seen so many courses that were just badly prepared, not taking into consideration just simple things like, you know, attention span on the internet. People, sometimes they try, they, for example, run some stationary classes and they try to create the same course experience online and doing like, you know, 45 minute lesson. And it will never work, you know. It's like the attention span is like five or six minutes and you should keep your lessons concise. And you obviously know that. Many people, they just figure out that, you know, OK, I'm going to do it like I do my class. And this just doesn't work in the internet. So the best courses that I've seen were the ones where the author was really engaged, but not only in passing the knowledge, but also in the creation, the process of creating the course. And there is a lot to be done in this process. Some of my courses, I just spent maybe four or five or six months creating the course, the outline of the course and the materials. Recording itself, I can do it easily. So it's like three or four days. But the whole process of creating the content and creating the best outline for the course and creating the best examples for the course, it's what makes the huge difference. And yeah, there's no one way. But basically, I feel that people are focusing less and less on the content itself and the course design process, which is crucial. And their attention is more on marketing and things that doesn't really matter for the output you get from the course. I think what you're describing to me is like the instructional design process or just the core design. And it's really fundamental to just generally, right, like the idea of design and not in the visual sense. But you have to design for outcomes and the experience of the learner and take that care to truly craft something that is useful to people. And then you get a good course. It's not like, how am I going to sell this to people and how am I going to extract dollars from wallets? It's how am I going to design something that's effective is the question that I think is the place to start. Yes, and you have to often, it's like people figure out that, OK, I'm going to do the course. And they just log themselves for like maybe a month or something and they come up with the course. It never works this way. So what you should do instead is basically, it's like, you know, your course is like, you should treat it like a startup. You should A, B test it. You should ask people. You should interview some folks. When you come up with the lesson, it's always like when I have the lesson idea, I always have some bullet points of what my students will accomplish with this lesson, what I'm going to give in this lesson. And this is pretty crucial. And I feel that sometimes we're missing the most important factor of our courses being our students learning something. And I often, like, I have a group of students when I create the course, I try to enroll as many people as I can in like better testing the course. And when I'm recording, I'm just sending the lessons over. I'm asking them questions. So it's really important to have people that will give you feedback in the process of designing the course. It's super important. Like the course, you shouldn't do it alone, you know, because then you face so many different problems that will end up in poor quality of the course. And it doesn't really matter if you're great in the topic or not, because like we've mentioned, for example, you might not know the difference and the line between beginners and maybe intermediate and users. And you basically will provide information that's not, you know, detailed enough because you won't go to the level of the students because you think that's obvious, because for you it might be, but for them, it's really. So for me, many times, and I've been doing this a lot, but now I find myself working with my students, and of course, some people who help me to create materials and stuff like that, but basically with my students throughout the whole process of creating a course and getting their feedback is really valuable. And oftentimes I wouldn't even imagine that, okay, I should do it, I should do a different example, or I should explain this more in detail and stuff like this. It's too obvious for me, but for them, it's a real problem that they address. I think it's interesting because what you described to me is fundamentally like a product design process, right? Like where the course is a product and you could transfer the same concept and idea to like a SaaS product, for instance, or some other thing where you're taking the care, you're talking to users, finding out what people actually need, and then, you know, designing an experience for them that they will then find useful and pay you for. And I think there's a lot of correlation here just in terms of what you've described. That's it, yeah. That's why I said it's like a startup, but like you mentioned, this is a product design. And many people do it, but they skip the really important parts. So basically, they just do this initial phase of the product. So maybe some checking whether there might be attraction for the product, and they do it pretty well. So create a campaign and some email list, and then they have webinars when they test whether this would work and maybe someone will pre-order the course. And this is great because you can get some insights from those people. But then I think that when they finally see that, okay, this might work out, they lock themselves in a closet for two months and they end up having a product that's not really fitted for the market. Maybe it's treated more like an essay or a term paper than a product at the end of the day. Yeah, I feel, yeah, yeah. You know, like you're writing an essay, basically, and you're not creating a course, you're writing an essay. Somebody will read it and they might get something out of it or not. Yeah, yeah, and you never test. Yeah, and maybe writing a book in a lake house. Yeah. Yeah, but it shouldn't be like this. It should be really like designing a great product that people are willing to pay for. But basically, it's like in a startup, you have to test the ideas and see what the outcomes are. If you're sitting down to research a new course, is your process different than if you were just learning something like you described in the blockchain earlier? When you're describing that, is that research process different when you're approaching a new course? No, I think it's pretty the same because it's all the like learning and teaching experience. It obviously depends on how many things you already know about the topic. The basic question for me is, who am I speaking to? Who am I creating the course for? And when you learn and research the topics, you have that answer in place because it's you, right? So basically, you know this person, so it's easier at the beginning. And most of the people skip that part when they create the course because they create the course as if they created this course for themselves. But many times, they address different audience. Now, they want to address themselves, but maybe from like five years ago when they were starting out or something like that. But instead, they just focus on how would I best learn this thing right now? And this might be a trap. So one of the things I think that's interesting when you start to teach or you're doing this sort of thing or you're developing courses is you get away from the practice, right? Like, so if you were teaching UX design, like how do you keep yourself grounded in the practice of UX design to be able to like confidently teach as an expert? Yeah, that's a great question too. I feel that many people have this, like for a start, they don't know whether they could teach because they know the topic well, but they are not great teachers. And they question themselves, all right, but I'm not the best person to pass the knowledge to anyone because I don't know how to teach. But you can learn how to teach. It's easy. And on the other hand, there are people who basically, they think that they know how to teach or maybe they know how to teach, but they don't know the topic because they teach too much and they lost the connection with the topic itself. And I've always been like what we've done for years now and what I try to do is always have people on board who are the best in class programmers like you do. So those are not teachers who doesn't practice the topic. They are always the best in class. Sometimes not the best in class. You don't have to be the best. Sometimes it's even better if you're exploring the topic, learning the topic, and then you have better connection with people who are actually willing to learn it. But the thing is that you cannot lose this connection to the topic itself. And for example, I've never taught subject twice. That's why I love video courses because you can just record it. And actually, this is how I started doing video courses for a short period in my life. I've been training people in class and I've been teaching them, although it was a long time ago, I've been teaching them ActionScript and Flash. So yeah, but I've run like maybe five classes. And obviously after the fifth class I've run, I felt that there's not much to improve. And I was so bored on the sixth that I've just tried to do it differently. And then I figured that, okay, I can record the sixth approach, which is pretty good. And then I don't have to do it again. So for me, it was always teaching something.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"new. And this is, I think this is crucial. If you're always trying to teach something new, then you are always learning. And you are always practicing the craft. And you basically pass the new skills to people. And this is nothing to be afraid of, because a lot of people are like, for me, I wouldn't teach blockchain right now. But I think I could. I mean, I could pass the information that I've learned through the period of these three weeks. And I think that having all the background that I have, the technical background, and I mean, in tech for years now, this actually gives me the confidence to pass this knowledge and teach this new topic, even if I'm not the best, you know, expert in blockchain. But I feel that I would be better suited to sympathize with the people who are just starting out and they will learn a lot from me. So you've built, you have multiple course platforms, and one of them is learnux.io. And it's a great place for folks that are interested in UI design tools, and it's full of video courses. And I'm wondering, how did you describe LearnUX? So LearnUX is a platform for UI and UX designers who are willing to learn some new skills and tools that are like pretty hot in the space right now. And this is a library that I've created quite a few years ago, I guess in 2018. Since then, I've updated it a few times. I feel that this project is like for me, it's complete. I could, now I can record, you know, new courses because there's always something new in the UX and UI space. But sometimes this is an example of a project that I just let it go for some time. And I always come back to this product that I create after some time. I try not to burn out too much. I've created this and I felt that it served many people. And then I have, when I have the real urge to go back to the project, I'm just, you know, I have this real passion to put in. So basically that's why also you told that this is one of my, a lot of different projects that I run. And I run SaaS businesses. I also create my own apps. I have my info products like LearnUX, and also I have a big portal with courses for Poland. And this is basically the great way for me to, to not to burn out and to have some space that would enable me to get new energy. And for example, for LearnUX, to go back to this project from time to time and create really great materials. So also maybe this is a realization that I have now that sometimes it's not like the course or the course that you create, the teaching process sometimes is, this shouldn't be a full-time job because you can easily, you know, probably run out of, maybe not ideas, but run out of energy quickly. I feel like I kind of fell in that trap with Egghead where I was trying to like, just, it was everything, right? I'm doing this one project, it's Egghead, and it just gets monotonous almost, and you lose perspective and it affects that, that product because it's your only thing you're focusing on. And for me, I've recently split off and started working on several products and it feels, it feels more interesting because I circle back and they're all related to each other in some form or fashion. But like this ability to like circle through various interests keeps your brain fresh when, you know, like you're working on this long-term. And it's like, for me, it's like for, I'm going to be working on these products for a long time and how do I bring my best self to them? And that's been a kind of a nice thing to be able to have multiple things to work on. Yeah, that's great. Right. And you always have this new levels of energy when you come back. And sometimes it's like, for example, for me recording a new course or creating a new material, it's like, I'm not recording until I have like this itch, until I'm like, okay, I have to record right now. Okay. If I don't have this feeling, I prefer to, you know, switch to some other task or maybe create some more examples, some more materials, learn some more. And this might be also a tip for people who want to, you know, jump into the studio. Many times we have studios here in Warsaw and we record many courses and you know, people come to the studio and I feel that they are not ready. Most of them are not ready to record. In order to record, you have to be like, oh, I have to let this out. Okay. You have to have this approach and this enthusiasm. And if this is not the case, if you think, oh, I can create a course on this and that, but so let's go to studio or maybe, you know, turn the mic on and see what happens. It's always frustrating. It's always a really bad process. But when you spend a lot of time creating the content and you feel this itch and you feel like, okay, I have to, I just have to tell it. I just have to pass this knowledge to people. Otherwise, I don't know. I forget what I wanted to say because it's too much and stuff like that. Then you have this great material and then you can have this fresh energy, right? You get the, and you also get it from this different projects of yours, right? When you work on different projects, you get so many ideas on what to teach. You know, you learn something basically every day. And this is so great about, you know, online projects as well. One of the things that's interesting is that LearnUX and Eduweb, both custom platforms, you built your own platform. And I was wondering what was missing from the kind of existing white label platform, had you decide to make your own platform to deliver your courses? Yeah, everything was missing. Yeah, it was really, it was really a painful experience, you might say, to develop the platform from the ground up. And we've basically never finished, you know, like, it's like, it's like, I could probably. Yeah, every day, something to do. Yeah. So, so it would be so much better and the world would be so perfect if I could just take the solution that's already there on the market, just build on top of it, and then only have to worry about, you know, recording great courses. So we were trying to, I was trying hard to find solutions that would be okay for me. And me being perfectionist, unfortunately, I could never find the solution that was perfect for, you know, learning platform. And basically, I feel that there is, it's really hard to find it even nowadays, we've been working on this different platforms for like, maybe 10-15 years now. And we came up with all the custom things that that we've developed, like, like the payment process and subscriptions and the player itself. So why is that? Well, I think that there's no one great way, again, what I tried to do, probably all my life, the biggest mission of my life is to create this learning experience, this online learning experience, better than the experiences that you have in class. And, and I truly believe that. But I still feel that no one has done it yet. And I feel that I want the mission to do it. So I tried to just come up with all of the different ideas that will bring me closer to this goal. And this is how I'm trying to rebuild all the things from the ground. I always question myself, you know, why is, for example, the most important part of your online learning experience when it's video course, why is this player, video player, just, you know, blank rectangle for all the other things on the website, like it's not connected to the learning experience at all, you have the video, but it's not connected to the notes you take to the experience. That's why we came up with this cue points with tagging with searching the library, because obviously, there is a lot more to learning than just watching the video. And probably that's why maybe that's why we don't have this, maybe this is great way to learn as a beginner now, because there nobody invented the platform that would allow you to quickly scan through the material, search through the transcripts, and the technology is there, but you have to work really hard to connect the pieces together. And I feel that we are getting closer, but it's really hard task. Technology, are they built on the same kind of core? Or are they separate projects? No, they are separate projects. And EdWeb is quite a big project, because it's like it has this database history of like maybe 13 years. And it's a big platform, we have over 200,000 clients on the platform. And we have, you know, our own hosting and stuff like that. It's really complicated. It's really a big project that we've been developing for years now, and we're still working on it. And Learn UX is just like a website that I quickly assembled. And there's not much in terms of like this, you know, whole learning process and experience. However, I feel that it's also valid points to mention that, okay, sometimes you don't really need it. For the purpose of Learn UX, it's okay to have this pretty simple player like embedded Vimeo. And just a simple thing, because people who are taking the courses, they want to go through the material, and they want to just update themselves on the new UI UX tools like Figma or Sketch and something like that. And probably this is like maybe a good way to put it. But if you have bigger platform with many courses, like we have like 700 courses, probably on adweb, you want to have better technology to cross reference the courses, you want to have better transcripts. And there's so much more that you can do. We even we create, for example, we try to engage people who are learning and we try to give them tasks, we have a custom built system that will put them in small groups, and let them have their own mastermind groups. And this is based on the progress in the courses that they have. So if you are a beginner, and you've learned JavaScript, now you're progressing to react, probably I can give you five people that are in the same place and have the same problems. And I can allow you to just meet in person, you know, in a zoom like experience with the specific task from react that you can work on together. And this is so much better than just, you know, having a simple learning experience. But sometimes you really don't need it. Now I've created and I've created a platform right now on Webflow. And it's great. It's Webflow LMS on the Webflow. And it's so great. It allows you to create your own course platform in a matter of minutes. And also it thanks to automations, and thanks to Webflow itself, it allows you to, you know, just customize it to the pixel. And, and this can be great for, you know, a large part of learning experiences. But on the other hand, it will never be something that I want to create, you know, that I take as a goal for me, because I want and I truly believe in the technology, helping solve this, you know, learning problem. And there is a lot of problems. But basically, I believe in changing the landscape with technology, not the better courses, because you can always create a better course. Yeah, but I want to change, change it to the better with technology, because I feel that there is a huge gap in there. I think it's, it's a lot easier to create when there are valid examples. And it's a lot more difficult when you are forging the way and actually creating those examples for other people. So like right now in this space, there is not a lot of advanced examples of these, you know, like learning experiences. And I feel like you are a person that's dedicated to creating those examples that we can look to and follow. And I really appreciate that in terms of your goals and how you approach online learning and, you know, like, like setting these examples and, you know, like this mutual kind of collaboration. And it's asynchronous and it's not explicit, but like, I love that we have these goals, and we're working on them together in a way. Yeah, of course we do. And we are all, you know, looking at different solutions and things that people come up with. And I'm really excited about the technology that's, that's, you know, right now changing the landscape, and it's progressing pretty quickly. And yeah, we can all learn from each other. That's so awesome. That's so inspiring. Greg, thank you so much for hanging out with me today and chatting about this stuff. And I really appreciate the work that you do. Thank you, Joel. And likewise, thanks. Thanks a lot. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hi Josh. Hey Joel. Great to hang out with you. Yeah. Same. So I'm really excited. One, I started out as a fan of your writing and the personal MBA is up there on my list of recommended books for anybody that wants to explore the business space and how to fight a hydra is really something truly special and I know it's something you're proud of and we love it around the house. It's just great. And I keep extra copies and I actually give that one out. What I wanted to start with before we dig into that and talk about courses and core systems is how do you approach a new complex subject when you set out to learn it? And I've asked this question in this series several times and you are the only person that's literally wrote an entire book that addresses the answer to this. Like I know that there's a lot to this, but how do you, what's your kind of basic framework for approaching learning something new and complex? Yeah, I just by personality and inclination, I tend to rabbit hole on things pretty hard. And the book that you mentioned, the first 20 hours is a book about how to acquire new skills, learn new things as quickly as possible. And I usually start just by, by being very specific about what it is I'm trying to do and constrain the topic as much as I can because otherwise it's easy to go off the beaten path, waste a lot of time, do way too much research, spend a lot of time like working around or learning around a topic instead of deciding exactly what it is I'm trying to do and then doing that thing as directly as possible. And yeah, I'll usually be very specific about what I'm trying to do. Just a little bit of research to learn how to think about this, learn how to approach it, find a few resources or guides or tutorials, and then jump into the practice or the implementation as, as quickly as possible. The general insight from first 20 hours is most people find the early stages of learning something new, tremendously frustrating. Adult learners hate to feel stupid. They hate to feel like I'm not doing what I want. I'm not accomplishing what I want. I can't do this. And so a lot of it is just trying to figure out like, how can you make progress as quickly as possible so you can get that positive reinforcement, like I'm getting better, I'm getting closer to what I want. And then how can you make sure that you spend a critical mass of time and attention early to get past that frustration barrier and to get to the point where, yeah, I'm seeing this take shape, I'm seeing myself getting the results I want. That's exciting. That's motivating. And from there, it's really just like, spend as much time as you need to get the result you want and then figure out, should I keep investing here or should I move on and learn something else? I think in my experience too, like a lot of times we want some difference in our life or we want to do a specific thing and you have to learn it and then you're bad at it, like you said. And that's really frustrating because you really just want to do the thing. You don't wake up in the morning and be like, oh, I'm really excited to read a book or take a course. And some people might be, but really it's about doing something and accomplishing something, some difference in your life that you want to achieve. And you have to go through this frustrating period of being a noob and suffering if you want to get there. Are you a course taker? Do you seek out online courses and take them when you're trying to learn something new? It really depends on the topic. Like I usually default to books, usually because it's easier to skim and scan and focus on the most relevant parts. Then there's a lot to be said for audio and video courses, but time is one of the big drawbacks of that. Like it's, I can think of maybe a handful of courses that I've signed up for specifically because I wanted to learn something about this specific topic. And there was a targeted course that was already made on it. I think we share an interest in audio. So Curtis Judd is a, he does audio for film, has a YouTube channel that's really good. And one piece of equipment, Sound Devices has an audio interface called the MixPre Series. And Curtis has a course specifically about the MixPre 2, how to set it up, what all the controls are, how to get certain results or set it up to do certain specific things. And I remember signing up for that course. I'm like, I have a couple of things I want to do. I went into the course, I found a couple of videos that were very targeted to exactly the things I wanted. I went through it and it was great. And I tend to default for courses around, is it specific to my interest? Can I get a result from this relatively quickly? If so, awesome. There are only a few courses that, that I think really optimize for that. And I'm sad. I wish there were more like, here's how to think about X or here's how to do this very specific thing. A lot of the courses that I see almost have this implicit default assumption that this course is the only thing going on in the learner's life and you're going to drop everything and you're going to spend the next week going through these tens or hundreds of hours of audio and video stuff. And that's not realistic. That's, that doesn't fit into people's actual day-to-day life. I think it's a design problem where that difference that people are trying to achieve in their lives, where they're trying to go from A to B is miss. And it's a focus on take the course versus make that difference in your life. And they talk about completion rates and that this sort of thing is a success metric for courses. But really it's, did this learner achieve what they were trying to do in their lives? And that can mean completion. Or like you said, you, you bought a really great course, went in, watched the videos that were very specific to your needs. And you were successful with that course because it was able to facilitate the difference you were trying to achieve in your life. And you sound great. So I assume that it was successful. Thanks. Yeah, it was a good course. And you can see where it comes from on a marketing page for a course. We have 60 hours of instructional content, big in the sense of bigger is better. You're getting more for your money, all of that. So I don't think, I think it's something that you can see where it comes from. You can see how it's rewarded, but then you just end up designing courses that are really frustrating for a learner because they may not necessarily be able to get the result that they're looking for in the time that they have available. Yeah, 60 hours is a long time. And then, like you said, there, and fundamentally this is something just observationally is that there is a ton of focus and there's a ton of resources out there for marketing and like launching courses and not a lot in terms of how do we design something that's excellent and effective for the learners to help them achieve what they're trying to do, which actually is like, what are good qualities or what is the, what are the qualities of a good course if you're sitting down, maybe even as a learning designer or a student? Yeah, I think there are two, two general magisteria of courses with very different objectives and very different outcomes. So the first would be like the Curtis Judd example that I brought up earlier, like very specific, very targeted, very niche. Here's the thing you want to do. Here's a piece of equipment you want to use. Here's a technique you want to learn. And the whole course is focused on how to get that particular result. Yes. Very targeted. The other course, which is the type of course that I've spent a lot of time thinking about and designing and, and creating a system around is maybe call it the, how to think about fill in the blank course, it's very like the transformation or the end result is not necessarily like some straightforward, practical, you were not able to do X. Now you're able to do X kind of thing. It's a shift in understanding and insight and being able to see the world or relate to other people or think about how you're doing things in a completely different way. And so for me, my, my first book, the personal MBA is essentially a book about how to think about business. It's a collection of mental models. It's a way of understanding what businesses are and how they work and what makes a good business and how you can make whatever it is that you're working in or on. Better over time. And so that's a very different instructional design problem than the very targeted instrumental, how can you get this result as quickly as possible? And I think that the, both the content of the course, but then also the method in which it's delivered needs to be very different because things like exposure to the information over a longer period of time is terrible for an instrumental course, because you're just taking too much time to deliver the end result. But for a, how to think about course, that could be very beneficial. Things like spaced repetition, things like sitting with a concept and trying to apply it or ask questions about the learner's life, get them to integrate whatever it is that they're learning from an informational standpoint, like really integrate it into their experience and their knowledge, make conceptual connections, hooks between what it is you're telling them, the information that you're delivering and how they can imagine themselves acting about these things in the future or making decisions about these things in the future. Kind of approaching like their personal identity and developing a system around it, instead of I'm going to learn to do this, it's I'm a person that does this sort of thing in their lives, like transformational change in a lot of circumstances, I would assume. And to me, it's like learning how to program computers and people focus very heavily on syntax and applying syntax and applying syntax where what is really difficult about being an expert computer programmer is not the syntax. And you learn that after a while, but until you have internalized that, it is, it feels impossible because you can't think about the problems and you'll do it and you'll learn some syntax. Totally. And I, you can see this division in programming books really well. So there's like the, I don't know, recipes or design patterns or algorithms book, like here's how you'd, here's how to set up a Redis instance and here are the data structures you can use and here are some recipes or common patterns or things that you can crib from the stack overflow approach. How, like, how do I do this? And then you have books like principles of software design. It's like very high level. How do you think about creating a program? What's important. What's not. I was just in, this isn't video, but I'm over my shoulder. There's Newt's four part set of computer science is on my shelf right there, which totally good. Yeah. And it's his work is fundamental, instrumental, like really changes the way that you view this entire domain as a whole. And yeah, the way that book is written is completely different than a cookbook or a set of recipes to get a particular result. And so, yeah, it's, I think a lot of this, when we talk about instructional design or course design, it's really beneficial to think through what, what type of course is this for you? Because not all courses are the same. I think there's a place for both too. Absolutely. You often need a cookbook. I want step-by-step because this is the exact problem I'm trying to solve, just show me how to solve it. We don't, I don't need to learn how to think. Just show me how to solve my problem. And that can be like, that can make the difference you need like long-term. It's the systematic approach that really makes the biggest change in my life personally, when I've experienced any sort of course or book or what have you. One thing I'm curious about, cause I know you don't, I don't believe you have any sort of public courses available, right? Like people can't go buy a course from you currently. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good one. But you do instructional design and you do teach people and you do probably more in the training than what you might call a formal course at this point. Is that right? Yeah. Not very well known. Personal MBA was a course before it was a book. I didn't know that at all. Yeah. So I, I had been consulting with people, coaching individual entrepreneurs for a while, and then I created a very early, this was a decade plus ago, and I don't know, that course was online for a couple of years and then the book came out and I wanted to focus on the book, but it was also taped and recorded in the era before good audio and good video and lighting was easily accessible. And so at a certain point, the production, I just looked at it. I'm like, I'm embarrassed about the production value of this course, like I need to redo it. What I'm doing now, because in the interim, I learned how to program. I actually learned how to program in the process of researching the first 20 hours. And some of my frustration about how I did the first version of the personal MBA course, now that I know how to program and I can actually control the system or control the frame in, in, in which the course is delivered, that's a superpower. Like I can do things with the course now that I couldn't do back then. And yeah, that's the core system that I'm working on. The things that I'm working on right now are really trying to do version two of the personal MBA course in a much better and more sophisticated way than version one was. I think it's interesting. And you talk about the personal MBA, which I believe is the currently the 10th anniversary edition is out there. So that was a while ago, but it, you started developing that as a course first, and I'm always flipping back in terms of design, because I feel like a lot of courses that exist or that I've worked on would have been well-suited to be designed like a book versus designed as a course first. And then I also, and you talk, and it's like workshops and what is the design process? And I'm wondering what the difference for you maybe is between if you're sitting down and thinking about a book versus sitting down and thinking about a course, is there a difference between process or how you would consider like the research and design aspect of those? I think there's a substantial level of overlap and it really depends on the book that, that you're working on and something like a well-constructed narrative nonfiction sort of book. I, a good example of this, this style done well is Range by David Epstein. Awesome book, full of insights and is structured in the form of a story or a narrative. It's an, you are going through an intellectual experience and imaginative experience with the author. And I think the process of writing that sort of book and developing a course is very different. If anything, a lot of folks and David included, the general approach is you write this book and then you can structure something like a speech, like a talk, like a training to abbreviate it a little bit, highlight the stories, deliver that sort of narrative experience in a shorter format. But those books tend to be really difficult to adapt to courses because instructional design was not part of the process. It's something that kind of has to be shoehorned in later. Telling a story versus instructional design, I think maybe is a way to think about it. Yeah, totally. And if you're focusing on the story, you don't necessarily want to leave out a bunch of that. So that's the story is the point. And but for me, I usually focus on writing how to think about fill in the blank books. It's not necessarily a narrative, although there will be stories and examples in it. I think about my work as creating a collection of mental models, a conceptual idea about how something works in the world, being very clear and isolating those for the reader. And so it's not necessarily narrative is here's how to think about something important. And then here are some stories and examples to help that stick in your mind a little bit better. And in terms of instructional design for the personal MBA course that I'm working on, it's structured very much at the mental model level. Here's this idea. Here's an explanation of what it is and how it works. Here are some examples. And then here are some questions or exercises to help you, the learner, integrate this and figure out how does this, can you think of examples of this in your own life? Can you think about examples of this in the world that you're already aware of? How might you apply this specific idea in your business or in your career or to accomplish the things that you want to do? And the discrete unit of the course and the book is entirely structured around this idea. Here's the mental model. Here's how to understand it. Here's what you do with it. Now you're creating a course and I know that you're building the course system, constructing your own course platform to produce this and deliver it to people. Why not just use something that exists? Why not go to Teachable and put it on there or one of the other perfectly fine platforms that exist for delivering a course? Why not use something like that? You mean aside from, for fun? Aside from, yeah, like aside from, I guess the personally, I enjoy doing this kind of aspect, which is frankly, I think that's really important, right? If you can and want to, then I think it's a very good idea to do that sort of thing. But otherwise, like what's the, is it just peer control or what is it that you seek when you're designing and building a course system for yourself? Yeah. So there's a practical element and then there's a kind of design problem element. So the design problem element and the, what got me thinking about this in the first place is that the personal MBA, if you go to the book, there are 250, give or take, discrete concepts that are discussed in the book. And when you map that to the default instructional design of something like a Teachable course or a Udemy course or whatever, it falls into, have you ever signed up for a course and you know, you go through the payment thing, you have your login, you log in and then it just feels like you get a bucket of stuff. It's like, welcome to the course. Here's everything. Left-hand side, navigation, introduction video, good luck. Yeah, totally. And with very little guidance, like you just, here you go. At a certain point, I would say probably beyond one E give or take course modules, that design structure really breaks down. The learner logs in and they are very overwhelmed by what they see. It's too much. There's too much to process. And without some guidance or helping people navigate through the course in a more systematic way, people can just get overwhelmed and say, yeah, this is not for me, request a refund or drop off. And they never get the value or the benefit from the course. And so one of the things that, that I thought a lot about, and I'm really curious to, to see if it works in the context of personal MBA, I want to have a course instead of asking someone to, all right, set aside six hours, half a day's work to go through this thing from start to finish, I want to see if a course, how to think about business course that's delivered over a much longer period of time, how that does. And it's much more straightforward, less overwhelming for a person to receive an email, your next course module is ready. Here's what it's about. Log in, the system automatically directs them to that particular lesson. It's maybe 10 minutes. And then they go through the lesson, they mark it complete. The system keeps track of that. And then the next day they automatically get the next lesson without having to think about it, without having to find where they are in the core system, log, remember to log in, do all of those things. Like, can you, a system that really removes the cognitive effort and the friction from someone going through this course from A to B, can you make it much smaller, less intimidating modules, just delivered over a much longer period of time, but kind of the crushing weight of the table of contents, right? Like you're staring at that and the, Oh, here's 60 hours. And it's just like, your brain says, yeah, you know what I could just Netflix right now, and I don't even have to think about this. And what's also interesting to me is because the personal MBA is not, it's linear because it's a book and it has a table of contents and you could read it back to front and it actually does read well, that's how I read it, but you don't have to, it is like something that you can go in and be like, I'm really struggling with this right now. And maybe you knew it a little bit, or you'd read the table of contents and you could jump in and get something that's pertinent to your current needs without having to go through it in a front to back sort of fashion. And that sort of thing is really fascinating to me from a course perspective too, because I think we could probably think about these things more like that than the linear progression through a very rigid outline. Yeah, totally. One of the features that I built in thinking along those lines was I call it random mode, instead of going through the course from front to back, maybe a learner goes through the course from front to back at first, and that doesn't necessarily mean that their engagement with the course has to end. They can continue going and then the system will just give them a random concept and there are enough of them in there for a person to be productively engaged with this course for potentially years. And as long as people are, the spaced repetition element is really important in terms of reminding people of certain things or a certain amount of serendipity is a wonderful thing to have. And then it's also a value for money thing. If you're finding spending time in this way is valuable, you could potentially do that for a much longer period of time. And that just increases the value of the course. It makes it more value. And also I think you're, what you're talking about, it allows you to increase that identity and that system and your needs grow and these lessons are something that you could learn again or have repeated or learn at a higher resolution. And one of my favorite concepts that I learned from Kathy Sierra is this idea of spiral learning, where we learn the first pass and it's low resolution and you just don't like, you get, you just, you see it, it's like a low resolution JPEG, you circle back, you do things in your life and you come back around and now it's like a higher resolution. You can see it and understand it. You're learning the same lesson at a different resolution and like it can come out and like at the perfect time in your life where you can now see this and use it in a different new way because you've advanced on several different fronts. And I love that concept. Yeah, that's amazing. So I love this idea of progressive review and that's something it's like you come in and you don't have the entire map laid out. It's almost like fog of war or like you jump into a video game and you can see that you're going to be able to take an adventure. And I was wondering if like, if that's sort of, of playful interaction with a course has influenced what you've built with your system. Yeah, a little bit. So I'm really just trying to in, in the design of the system, reduce cognitive load as much as I can. And the jumping around, all of that is, is possible and encouraged. Like the system keeps track of what you've seen and you're not going to see things that you have already seen unless you opt in for that or want it. I've spent a lot of time. I think the serendipity elements, you can see it with, with the cohort based courses, yeah, you're signing up with, you're signing up for a certain amount of knowledge transfer, information transfer, but you're also signing up for the serendipitous sort of community interaction that a lot of people find valuable. I think there's a time and a place for that. And I think that's also can sometimes fall into the trap of, okay, now taking this course as your part-time job. Like assuming that people are going to spend six hours a week doing this thing, showing up at a certain time, doing a certain activity, being responsible, having other people that are going to be there at the same time, doing the same thing, that sort of thing. And I think that there's another way of structuring courses. That's a little bit more think personal individual mentorship, like a one-on-one relationship between the learner and the instructor where there's a back and forth conversation that's happening. It's just asynchronous. So instead of hopping on zoom and having a call for an hour where the instructor is teaching the material over and over again, like you can have videos, you can have audio, you can have the instructional information transfer stuff pre-recorded and at the learner's convenience. And then depending on the exercises or the questions that you ask, if the system allows it, the instructor sees it and then can reply and there can be a back and forth that's asynchronous and extremely valuable. And to the learner, it just feels like it's them and the instructor, the person that they want to learn from instead of having this like mass group experience all the time. So I'm really trying to build the serendipity for me in the course is what is it going to be like to have a whole bunch of people going through this course and be at different parts of the system, different parts of the information thing. But there's this really interesting interaction of, let's say a learner has a particular experience and shares an example around a concept. As the instructor, I can take that, make it an example, update the course material, and now everybody who goes through the course after that is going to benefit from the experience of another learner going through exactly the same thing. There's something emergent and cool about that kind of progressive enhancement of the course material over time. It makes sense, it's relationship based too. And I've always said, and people, because people will go out and I need a mentor in a certain thing. And I'm like, you can buy a book and that is a mentor relationship. That person might not even exist on this planet anymore, but you can learn from them and have that conversation. But what you're talking about is a growing system where this is an ongoing conversation that we're going to have together and your work actually matters. And when you have something interesting, we can bring that back into it and evolve the overall system for everybody, including that individual. Exactly. Are you like testing? Do you, how do you test a new course system? Is this something that you invite people to or that you just work on until the big reveal happens and you tada it on folks? What's your kind of approach to like testing course material? Is it the material or the system itself? The system and the material. I don't know. I don't know how to separate them in a lot of ways, but yeah, the system itself. Sure. I've had various incarnations of my system running in, in beta with other courses for.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"a while and also going back to your question about like why build one instead of, I think version one of the personal MBA course was on Word, WordPress with a bunch of plugins and whatever, and it broke all the time because WordPress is updating and the plugins are updating and the external third-party systems are updating and at some point somebody is going to update something that breaks things and when it breaks, it's not their responsibility, it's your responsibility to fix. Everybody gets mad at them. They get mad at you. That is when I made a holy vow that I would never use WordPress for anything ever again, if I could avoid it. And one of the great joys that worked far beyond my initial expectations in doing the beta version of this system is that I've had software running courses in production for I think six years now, and they are rock solid stable because nothing changes unless I change it. You have to do security updates, you have to a minimum amount of maintenance, but it's possible to develop a core system that is feature complete for exactly what you want to use it for. And if it's complete and there's no, no major glaring security vulnerability that you need to patch right away, like it just sits there and runs and you have to spend a lot less time and energy thinking about it and maintaining it than an external third-party system. So I'm completely out of your control at that point. Like you're able to gain the control and stability because it's something you designed and can at every level fix or update or do what you need to do with your system. And you already know how it works. And so if you need to change something or add something or delete something, like that's a much more straightforward problem that of a WordPress installation to try to duct tape and superglue something in or out. And the downside of owning your own system versus a third party system is it doesn't improve unless you spend the time and energy and attention to make it do something. And so at least for me, I want to have enough control over the system that I can control the process and what the learner sees and what the whole experience feels like from start to finish. And that's not going to change dramatically over time. Like I have a set of things that it really needs to do if it does those things and the uptime is great and learners are happy, like problem solved. Can you briefly, and this'll take us out here, I would like a brief technical explanation of the stack, what has gone into your core system? Like how does it run and how did you build it? Sure. So I learned Ruby in the process of researching first 20 hours. I love it. It is a joy to program in and I do not use the vast majority of Rails. I use Sinatra and I love Sinatra because it's lightweight. There's no auto magical generator code things that are putting code in my code base that I didn't put there myself. And Ruby and Sinatra is the base. I use Redis as my primary database and single store of truth version. I'm now in version three of my course system. Version two was on Postgres. And I found that at least for my, for my uses, it was way overkill. It was very complicated. Schema migrations were a pain in the butt. It was, there was a very long cycle time, like between me having an idea, implementing it and going through all of the Postgres schema stuff in order to make that happen. So with what I found is with core system, like you're dealing with really simple information. So a key value store is amazing. This is data types are perfect for this sort of thing. And if you want to store strings and lists and arrays and sets and all of that good stuff, like Redis already has it. And because it's text, it's relatively small. And, and over time, Redis's persistence and availability and backup capabilities become really great. And the, the benefit is the development time is very straightforward. Like you just keep notes on how you're still, I just, I essentially have a text document that's a schema file. It's a reference document for myself of like where I'm storing things, what the keys look like. But from there, you're dealing with very small amounts of information. And so when it's in memory in Redis, the whole site is just blazing fast. And it's definitely a not so traditional stack. Most people still consider using Redis as a primary store of value to be on the risky unorthodox side. For me, it's been amazing. Some of the fun things that that has allowed me to do is I have a version of the core system that is optimized for group training experiences. And say, for example, I'm doing training for a corporation and there are 25 learners going through the course at the same time. With Redis, I can do something that would otherwise really bog down a system. Like for example, I can put a on, on keystroke JavaScript thing in a comment field and every time somebody adds a character to their notes, it's throwing it up to Redis. And what that allows me to do on the backend as the instructor is I can have a module page and refresh it. And I can see what all of the learners are taking in their notes fields as it's happening. And if I shift from instructional delivery into something like a live conversation, I already have all their notes. Like I can read those in advance. I can call on people and say, Hey, you had a really good example about this. Would you like to jump in and explain this for the group? Like I had one, one of my clients is that's pretty close to mind reading. It is really cool. And because the overhead of Redis, because it's so fast, I can have thousands of requests per second over a relatively small user base. And Redis can handle it fine. And those sorts of things like understanding where the technology is and what cool things does this unlock that something like a teachable, like just would completely break and fall down trying to do that's really fun. And really cool. It's a great space. Like you have an infinite space to explore and try new things, help people succeed. Yeah. And then architecture, architecture wise, I just use a very minimal amount of JavaScript. I know enough to be dangerous, but I don't know enough to do like all of the fancy front end react sort of things. I know a lot to be dangerous. Yes, you do. I can be dangerous with JavaScript all day. Josh, I think we could geek out on this for hours and I look forward to in the future. I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. Thank you so much. And I look forward to seeing the personal MBA and I will be signing up on day one. Awesome. Thanks so much. It was a pleasure to be here. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm really stoked to talk to you because we've worked together for a while now and we've had similar interests and we both like making courses and teaching people and helping people grow as software developers. So there's a ton of stuff to talk about. I'm really curious about Rust and your experience building a course platform and creating a course in that space. I wanted to ask before we dig into that though, like when you were sitting down to learn something new, something complex, whether it's technical or otherwise, what's your approach to learning a complex subject? I will say that I started my career with the ActionScript 3 like bible book, which if you've never seen it before is like this giant thick like meaty flash book, right? And I just sat down and I banged my head against it and sat in a computer lab that I had access to with the Adobe software that I had access to and I just effectively banged my head against the book until it works. That was the book I learned how to code off of, that's what's funny to me because that's literally like how I learned how to program was with that with Essential ActionScript 3 by Colin Mook was my introduction and just like shouldered into it until like it finally clicked like, oh this is what a class is. It took me so long, I didn't get it. For so long I think, especially around that time when I was, I had no idea what programming really was. I was like, why are these symbols like that? Are they important like that? Or do I, does it need to be like that? Like does the, what is that? Just stumbling along and like, that's the really, that's the way that I then learned too. So like at one point I was doing Haskell professionally and getting paid for contracting doing that. And the way I learned that is banging my head against it for years and it's the same thing with anything else. So now when I run up against like a library that is underdocumented or something like that, I'm just like fall back on the old process, just bang my head against it until it hurts quite a bit. And then for some reason I'm a person that keeps doing that. So I don't really have a, yeah, nobody's going to like that answer because that's a really painful answer. Just shouldering in and suffering until you have learned it enough to use it is kind of like how I might describe that. Yeah. What keeps you going? Like what keeps you motivated when you're in that process though? Because it's very frustrating. I like personally, like when I learned how to code, it was pre-internet. And I remember like I called it the chapter four problem because I would get there and it would just be like, I don't understand. This isn't for me. I give up now. But what keeps you going when you, you're like, how do you know it's worth it? How do you know it's worth it is a very different question than how do you keep going? Maybe that's true. So like when I learned how to program, I didn't know what programmers got. I charged. So I started my career freelancing and I was charging like $15 an hour or whatever. Right. Like, like basically what people always are like, yeah, this should be the minimum wage. Yeah. And I was like, I don't know, it's better than working at McDonald's. So I guess I'll keep doing this. It's true though, too. And it makes it easier to get gigs at that point too. And I'd like just charging a really low rate. So people will say yes. And actually give me the chance to try. There is something to be said for like, when you don't have the skills and the expertise and the negotiation ability and the network and the audience and all of these other things, right. It's just getting something. But also later on, you learn that software engineers don't make $15 an hour, but like, I didn't know any of that. So like the motivation for me is intrinsic, like it's internal. It's the only way that I do things is if I want to do things. Yeah. I got recently diagnosed with ADHD and stuff like that. So like, it makes a little bit more sense to me these days, but like, I don't do well with authority and external deadlines and people telling me what to do and all of that kind of shit. Imagine that. So I don't, if it's not internal motivation, if it's not something I want to be doing, if I don't have like my reason for doing it, whatever that is, whether it's, I like, even to the extent of like, I need to pay rent almost isn't good enough for me to keep my, that's just somebody else telling you what to do. And like, I don't have people depending on me either. So if you have a brood, right? Like if you have people that are relying on you to pay their rent, that changes the whole perspective. Cause I'm, I'm such the same way. If you tell me what to do, like my first instinct is like, no, just flat. I didn't even, it's totally reasonable request. Just like, no, I'm not going to do that. But no, I think that actually makes my next question more interesting because you're focusing on rust and you've chosen an area to, to teach and educate in. And to me, based on what you just said, that means that, you know, like this is something that you want to do that you really like, that you think is a good idea. And, and what, what drew you into the programming language rust? And why did you choose that as a focus in terms of your own expertise development and then as something to teach to others? I feel like on some level, I've always had a fairly good, like ability to pick the next technology I need to be working with. Like I picked react in like 2013, 2014, and that's been going for almost 10 years now, which is pretty nice. And like, obviously I don't pick everything correctly, but like rust to me seemed like a thing that all of the smart people that I knew were talking about again. And I went to use the language and probably due to my personal contextual history with other languages and having worked across a number of them at this point, I saw rust and I was like, well, it has all the things I like about like the JavaScript ecosystem, right? Like NPM for all of its works. And like the package management works of JavaScript is really nice. Like, I don't want to go back to a land where like, like go before modules or like C plus or something like that. Right? Like, I don't want, I mean, like at least Maven has some like dependency management kind of stuff, right? Like I don't want to go back into a world where it's like, we expect you to have all of the source that you're ever going to compile in this repo. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. So like NPM and then NPM scripts and all of like the higher level tools on top of that were like things that I really like about the tooling that I'm working with and rust has that. And it has that I think done at a better level, right? Like. It's an iteration on that concept too, right? Like, so they're iterating on NPM, which is iterating on, you know, Ruby gems, which is iterating on, you know, like the stuff that proceeded before that too, I think. Yeah. I mean, there's something to be said for the fact that like rust came after all of these other things, right. Which means they got to learn from all of them. And like, that doesn't always happen. Sometimes people are just like, Oh, I want C, but like, whatever, some minor change. And it's like, then it's just C without the ecosystem. Yeah. But yeah, so I saw that. And then I started using rust and I really liked it as a language in addition to all the tooling and stuff. And I saw the capacity for it to be like embedded in other languages like JavaScript. So this was like, I don't know, three years ago or something. I was making the decision to like get into rust and whatnot. So that kind of goes back. And I'd assume over time, like when you first learned how to program and you sat down with the action script three book to like shoulder in, that's a totally different experience than when you sat down to like learn and research rust. So what was that approach? Like, like, how do you approach that? I'm sure it's similar, like you're still shouldering in, but you have a higher resolution insight into it also. So what was your research process when you, you know, decided to teach rust? When I decided to teach rust, my iterations looked a lot different, right? When I decided to learn rust, it was somewhat similar, but like, I've been through, I don't know, almost double digits in languages these days. Like, so like, seeing new syntax to me isn't scary. Yeah, you don't have to learn what an array is. And it's not a concept that you have to even think of as a, as an example. Like, yeah, I can talk about things and make them sound scary, just like anybody else, right? As a teacher, I try not to do that. But yeah, when I go to learn something for like the perspective of teaching it, you have to learn it on a much deeper level, right? You have to learn it because people are going to ask you really random questions about things that you never thought about. So like researching to teach is researching to figure out what everybody else's problems are. Whereas researching to learn is like researching to get past your own roadblocks, which you can often skip without even like really addressing, right? But if you're researching to teach, you have to go and you have to find the things that everybody else is running into. You have to aggregate those into, okay, most people will hit this, a bunch of people will hit that. And then like, these are the things I need to explain to like, get everybody to the next step without, without doing the thing of like, I'm going to dive into three concepts you don't know, because I'm smart, right? Kind of showing off your knowledge versus helping them solve their problems, I guess would be. Yeah, I feel like that's a problem. A lot of people fall into where it's like, I'm going to show off that I know this. When often teaching to people who don't know what you know, you will look like you don't know what you're talking about to people who want to be aggressive, right? Or whatever. And you look at them and you're just like, yeah, but I'm talking to somebody who doesn't know what any of that is, right? Like, I can't use these words. I can't use the word idempotent. If you don't already know what that is, because that's just layering like another big technical word on top of whatever I'm trying to teach you. I'm going to say it does the same thing every time you call it, right? Like there, there are different ways of talking about things that you need to definitely jargon has its place. And it's like, but it's, it's like a lossy format, right? Like it's compression of, of concepts and do something you can speak tersely. And then it can be thrown around and uncomfortable ways, maybe, or just the context where it isn't, it isn't appropriate, right? Like in some contexts, it's the higher level, like the next steps to like what we've talked about in the past and what we've been talking about for years at this point in the instructional design arena, where what you're doing was building basically higher level heuristics and abstractions and procedures and like building on top of at some point, talking about things being commutative or idempotent or whatever big word you want to use, like means something to the other set of people who are also speaking at a certain level about a certain thing in a certain way. That very often is not what you do when you're teaching somebody something, but it is something that two people on the same sort of wavelength can say and communicate ideas faster. Right. It's like, not everybody needs to get to that point, but like, it's just another aspect of that. Yeah. It's like impression. Optimization at the end of the day is how I kind of look at it. Cause you know, like I find it's in, you get down into like initialisms and whatnot, where we're reducing things into just purely their initials. When we're having a conversation, it's like, hold up. I have no idea what, what that even means. And I've been doing this for a long time. And you know, it's like, you have to be aware of that, especially when you're teaching people and introducing new words and not supporting that. It's huge with rust and you're designing it and you've decided to teach it and you have a course. What, what are people looking for? Like, what is bringing people to rust the language in terms of their problems or the difference that they're trying to achieve with a new programming language? I think I see really like two big groups. I see the people who are either all, we're already working somewhere or had just got a new job and now they have to deal with rust on some level. Right. So they have to figure it out and they have to be productive at it because now for some reason it's their job to deal with it. And then there's the other group of people who are like, and I focus on more dynamic language people like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, I don't really teach for C developers. That's not to say the content doesn't work for C developers. It's just that like, I'm going to talk a lot less about memory and registers and what, what have you. And I'm going to talk a lot more about like things that JavaScript people care about. Yeah. Kind of to switch gears and maybe talk a little bit about instructional design philosophy. What makes a good course in your opinion? I think that the higher order bit for me is that transfer, right? Like if you do a course and the person ends your course and they're like, went through a course, but like, I don't really know what to do with any of this. That's a, that's not a good course, right? Like you failed something for somebody in this case, it's somebody specific, but like transfer being like knowledge transfer, where they're taking what they have learned in your course and then applying it to whatever is going on in their life. Right. If they can't use what you taught them to do what they want to do, then they are no better off than where they were when they started. Right. If you're at the same place, when you start the course and when you end the course, like the course, isn't a good course, right? Like the person hasn't learned anything. Well, it has to make a difference, right? Like, so if there is no difference then. Yeah. So like they have to be able to do something that they weren't able to do before. And that's what I, that's what kind of what I mean when I say transfer. How do you know when, you know, like when you're watching people or talking to people that are actually involved in your course right now, like how do you know that they are meeting their goals when they're going through the process? So we have a discord for the rest of venture stuff and the people in the discord are doing various things like for realistically, sometimes I won't know. Yeah. Right. Some people go through, go through the workshops, do all the work, get all the stuff done. And then they walk off to their job and they start doing it at their job. And they really just like, they're done. They never come back or like they learned the thing they needed to learn. And now they are using it, which is great, but like not something that you can necessarily guarantee that they come back and tell you, but there are people that come back and go, Oh, I did like the 2048 course or whatever. And I made this game and now I'm going to make a clone of wordle on my own. Right. So like when you see people starting to do that, I think that's when you have a thing that is capturing that goal of like the transfer, right? If the people are able to take the course and then feel like they can go do their own thing, even if they like hit a bunch of roadblocks, when they go to do it, if they feel like they can do their own thing after they do the course, there's something good about that. Right. And you can follow that. And then when they try to go do their own thing and they start running into roadblocks, you get that feedback because they're in the discord or whatever. And they're like, Oh, I'm trying to do this thing. We didn't really cover this in the course or whatever. Have you had any success stories since you started teaching that were like, just made it just feel like this is totally worth it. I think anytime anybody ever does one of my things and is like, yeah, I accomplished it. I did what I set out to do before I used your thing is like just such a bright star moment, right? Whether that's like, Oh, I eventually got a promotion from going through all of your stuff. Or like, I learned this thing and now I feel more confident or just I did like I have that open graph images course, right on again, I love that bunch of people go through that. It's kind of hilarious, because a lot of people like go try to do simpler versions of it, that eventually realized they actually need the thing the course does. And they end up like they've known about the course the whole time. And then they eventually hit a point where they're like, Oh, that's why this exists. Okay. And then they go through it. And then they have their open graph images being generated in a serverless function cached on cloudinary, whatever. And they're just they're like, they have they have the thing that they wanted in the first place. And that's a success, right? Like, when I think about like the rest of venture stuff, I'm thinking about transfer skills. But even on the level of like, this project is a useful project. It teaches you a number of skills like serverless functions, puppeteer, playwright, whatever cloudinary, but the result of that course is really like, you have the thing that you wanted, when you came to it, right? It's a kind of a direct action course, as opposed to a curriculum course. I think that's really interesting in on a couple of levels. And one of them is, how do you decide what to build for an example, either through a course, or, you know, whether you're writing or how do you decide what the example is going to be? I think people struggle with that a lot. That's definitely research, right? Like there's either, there can be problems that I have, right? In which case, it's like, it's like, it's a problem that I have, like the open graph image thing, where then like, that's the thing that other people also ran into, or it's research, and I'm researching like, what problems other people are having, and what they're having trouble with. And then you build a example, basically based off of that, right? Like, what example can I build that addresses the problem these people are having, in a way that lets me explain and build up to it, so that when they end it, they can go off and do whatever they want, whenever they want. When you're in the design process, do you get any feedback from people? Do you have a way of sharing that or, you know, beta testing, for lack of a better term, the content from, you know, like during the workshops, or how do you approach this testing cycle and getting feedback from? Yeah, it's a very large spread, actually, from writing blog posts, and seeing how people react to it, to doing YouTube videos, and seeing how people react to it, and live streaming, and seeing what people, what questions people have when they come into the chat, all the way through to like, I've now gone through a bunch of the problematic stuff. I've designed a curriculum or a set of lessons or whatnot. And there's a set of videos now, that are in like their raw cut format, like a rough edit. And I'll give the rough edit to somebody and be like, this, like, do you want to go through this, like actually do it. And finding the people who will actually like, full on beta test something for you, and actually do it, and then actually provide feedback, is a very hard thing to do on its own. But if you can find that group of people, you're pretty good, right? What is the live streaming? How has that influenced your kind of process and design in terms of developing a course? I think that's really interesting. It's something you've been practicing for quite some time. The live streaming is really interesting, because it's like an early testing ground, right? It is a, I can do very early, like I have a inkling of an idea about something, right? Or I have a just a thing I want to accomplish or something like that. And I can take that to a live stream. And nobody really expects polished content on a live stream, they expect like to be able to hang out and talk to you. And it's a, I bet some point, I imagine we'll talk about marketing, but like a deepening of a trust relationship with the people that I interact with on a regular basis, around all of the the rest courses and material and stuff like that. Live streams are really good for like, being I'm a person and you're a person and we're talking. And like, you can ask questions as I'm going through this, if you don't, like recognize something. And like, I can answer your questions. But also every question somebody asks, is like a marker, a note, a point that I go back to, right? So that's what that is. I haven't done a lot of I haven't done a lot of live streaming, but I've done in-person workshops, which in a way is a live streaming and meet space, I guess. And it's the same thing, right? Like if you do this and you're either running through your examples, but the times when people actually ask questions, and if you do these things more than once, you'll notice there's these natural places where people ask questions or you can, you know, you'll see the looks on their faces or the questions come up in chat. And I think that's like that experience is pretty fantastic in terms of design, because you don't have to have, it's not as polished and permanent, I guess. I think that the people always feel like they're bothering other people, right? Like they always feel like, oh, I shouldn't ask this. I'm bothering them. Oh, this feels like a silly question. Like I shouldn't have to ask this. I should just go figure it out on my own. But the key insight there is that what they don't understand is that every time somebody asks me a question anywhere on the internet, in my life, whatever, that is a thing that I know that somebody had to ask. And that feedback is really invaluable when it comes down to actually building courses and curriculum and doing the actual work of developing something that addresses the problems that people actually run into, right? So like, I'm always happy to like get questions. And like, sometimes, maybe I don't know, sometimes maybe I don't have the time, sometimes whatever. But I'm always happy to like, get a question. And then I can at least be like, oh, that direction. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a common problem, just in people want to like, either figure it out or don't want to pester us. And us being the anybody, they don't want to pester anybody about whatever, you know, they think their questions bad and won't ask it. And it's really true that the phrase, there's no bad questions, I think really kind of holds up. Yeah, I have, I have feelings about that phrase, because like, there are no bad questions, if you're doing it while you're learning while whatever, but there are bad faith questions. Yeah, I think that there's definitely an asterisk. No, no bad questions asterisk asked in good faith. Because you can definitely I mean, the internet's full of trolls. So it's a wonderful and horrible place. You've been running your course for a while now. And it hasn't, you know, it's I think you were about six months in and I don't know if this has been a concern yet. But maintenance of video courses, in particular maintenance of courses in general, I think is can be difficult. And I was wondering, you know, how much time are you finding yourself having to maintain versus working on new stuff on the horizon? Course maintenance for me is tied to version bumps in the like, libraries and stuff, right? I find that to be a very useful, like, point at which to revisit the content. Because there's a natural change, right? So for example, Bevy came out with like 0.6. And the workshop that I initially did is 0.5. So there are, I don't want to call them substantial changes to the workshop, but there are opportunities to remove some of the accidental complexity of the workshop. So it's a good opportunity for me to dig in and be like, Okay, should I redo these videos or not? And I think those are ones that I'm redoing. But the say, digital garden CLI course, or like another CLI course or something like that might just need a note, right? It might just need like a Hey, you know, you're going through this video. And while you're going through this video, you're going to end up with, like this one thing that you need to type in addition, right? So like, it's definitely like when the software version comes out, that's when I deal with do I redo the thing or not? That's when I revisit is the instruction here actually achieving its purpose, right? Because at that point, I will have like a bunch of feedback from people who have gone through the courses and whatnot. And I take that into consideration as well. When you're thinking about your courses, and it's multi modules, and you have existing modules, and there can be improvement there and refinement versus creating additional courses that cover more ground. How do you balance and like, maybe what's the trade offs between working on new content and refining what exists already? Oh, like I said, like the refining, the old stuff happens at particular times, right? There is part of the reason I have a trigger for that, right? Because I could do whatever I want to do at any given time. But software bumps and that there are enough version bumps of libraries or crates or whatever that are used in the workshops, that that makes a natural point at which to revisit. So like, for Rust Adventure, it's a series of workshops, right? Like, a lot of people call it a course or whatever and total. And that I think is a, it's a marketing thing that I probably have to lean in more than lean away from, like, everybody is going to call it a course or whatever, right? Like, like, yeah, meet people where they are, basically, right? Like, I don't need, I don't need people to call it workshops. I don't need people to whatever, but it is a whole set of things, right? So having a corpus of content that is in a couple different streams is where my head is at for that. And that needs more new stuff, right? So I can tell you there's a couple of streams on Rust Adventure right now. One of them is like a CLI stream. And one is like a games stream. And one is like a serverless stream. And then there's a language stream, right? Like, so the first phase of Rust Adventure was basically answering the question, what can you do with Rust? Because that was the most common question I was seeing from people. It was like, I like, what can you even do with this? And like having a bunch of workshops that address that question, like, you can do serverless functions, and you can use CLI tools, and you can build games, and you can whatever made a lot of sense. So there now needs to be like additional, from beginner to advanced in each of those streams, and also a from absolute beginner to being able to take the workshops stream itself. So like the new content is really important in the sense of Rust Adventure. I don't know that's true everywhere, because I feel like a lot of other places do very different kinds of workshops. They'll do one on this framework and one on that framework, and they don't really connect. But I'm trying to build more of a larger curriculum with Rust Adventure. So do you have an idea of what finished looks like in terms of the broad curriculum? It's a really good question there. I have the idea that I have in my head right now, right? And that will not be the finish line, I don't think. But there\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"is the like language learning stream, like the, the intro to Rust, like why would I use it, who cares, some syntax, some like, here's your first program kind of stuff, right. And then there's the use cases streams. And then at some point there is the, I don't need another CLI project. How do I build really good CLIs? And that's like the cap capstone on the end of like the CLI stream set of workshops. Right. It's like the, like, do I include flags to output as JSON or human readable or whatever? Right. The like higher level questions that you can now consider now that you have the underlying like factual skill of this is the crate I'll use. These are the libraries I'll use. This is how I write like a thing that accepts arguments or whatever. So that's what I'm thinking about in terms of like the desired end goal for probably this year is the, there's a bunch of streams that you lead into each other, you can go from language to use cases, and then at the end of the use cases, there is the, this is how you do this on like a, on a metal level. I think what's interesting is because the metal level you describe, you know, like, like what are the considerations that go into really building a great CLI is that expands beyond boundaries of a particular programming language. And that's something that you could probably do in many programming language and might even be useful as a, you know, like as a learner to watch something like that, just so I have a good idea of that. And then, you know, like think about the language level stuff. As a separate concern, even. Yep, for sure. I like, I don't think you need to like sort of take the language workshop before you take the use cases, but it's important to like, just in time, provide that information, right? Like if somebody wants to go through the link, there are people who are like, I need to learn the syntax and I need to learn like the hello world before I can do anything with anything else. And then there are other people who are like, so I'm pretty used to building like hearing SaaS services as my first project, I want to do that. And then they'll go do that. And they'll like, they'll need little tidbits. Like they'll need to reach out. I need you to have those like reach out points available to them. But I don't think that everybody starts in the same spot or ends in the same spot, right? That's the way interesting. The, the idea that people have their own kind of pet project where they learned every language in the same way. Yeah. Well, one of the things that people try to do a lot with because they grew up in a traditional CS education, like C language environment, is they try to implement linked lists and they're like, this is a simple data structure in my head. This is the basic data structure because they've been told it's the basic data structure or whatever for years and CS degrees and stuff like that. Interviews. Yeah. And like, that's not necessarily true. So there is some aspect of like, if you're writing Java and you want to move to like Haskell, you don't want to write your Haskell as if you were writing Java. Right. You want to learn the new paradigm. So there is something to the effect of like, maybe your pet project isn't applicable to the new situation and maybe you should reconsider, but there is definitely like a whole bunch of approaches that people take and they're not necessarily linked, which means that like they may jump from halfway through the 2048 course to like start to do the serverless course because they had something come up at work or whatever. Right. And the way that I think about it is like super Mario 2d world levels. Is the way that I think about rest of venture. So like there's the serverless world and the language world and the whatever, whatever. Right. At some point you unlock the other worlds, but that doesn't mean you like completed every level to the extent that it can be completed or whatever. Side quests and mini games and that sort of thing. Yeah. I love that. I actually, I think the video game and kind of map analogy works pretty well for a lot of this in terms of learning and how we structure it. There's a lot of platforms out there. There's, you know, platforms like Teachable and Podio where you can just go in there and you can throw your videos up there and kind of, kind of run with it. And I'm, I'm wondering why wouldn't you use something like that to just publish your course and cause you've gone through and built a custom course platform. And why not just use something kind of off the rack where you can self-serve and go from there? I saw this question and the questions that you sent to me. And I was like, my, my response is like, convinced me to use one of them. Right. Yeah. There's salespeople might be able to, um, I don't, I, you know, easily my, my, my strongest one would be like, like, it's really easy. You can just put your videos up there, Chris, and push a button. And you're all of a sudden you're selling subscriptions. So it's easy peasy. I mean, that's fine and all, but like a zero control over so many things, right? Like from payment structures to what you can put on the platform to like, whatever. I guess the way I'll phrase it is like, YouTube has a really good UI for setting up a playlist and handing somebody a link and them being able to go through it. With comments and whether people like and dislike and like all of that kind of stuff. If you're not doing a better job than YouTube is, why should I use your thing? Right. Like there is a lot of value in putting up like that YouTube playlist or long video or whatever, because if it's useful, then people will watch it and then you start developing that relationship with them, et cetera, et cetera, like you've been helping people. Right. When I think about like, why did I build my own, you called it a course platform. I don't think anybody's building course platforms really. A platform has a very specific meaning in my head. It means that other people are building businesses on top of your thing. And nobody's really doing that. You're building. Yeah. But it's one business. It's my business, right? Like it's not a platform. It's my product. Yeah. But it's your platform. It's, I mean, it is, it's like your platform. It's literally, you are standing on it and you are the only person standing on it. I'm just going to argue with you for just a second, like semantically speaking, like I agree, like in, in the software world, when we consider a platform would be something where other people are using it, where it's white labeled or something. But I think what you built is, is absolutely a platform and you could take it and other people could use it, whether you chose to do that or not. It's probably, and it's also a different problem space and there's lots of new questions that come up. But I'm going to just say that maybe it's, we don't call it a platform. It's your soapbox, but like it is yours and you are standing on it and you are delivering your courses on it. So for me very much, like, I think it is, I think of it as a platform and that's, that's, there's just kind of difference. I do understand where you're coming from. I think soapbox is even worse of a term. Oh, it absolutely is. I'm doing that thing where you offer like a worse alternative and in hopes that you can win your semantic argument. Yeah, for sure. It is a worst time. Yeah. I mean, if, if there's one person on your platform, it's not a platform, right? Like it has to be enabling other people. Like YouTube is a platform because people build businesses on YouTube and have multiple businesses that YouTube is helping drive. You get into this for so long because like the users, like your learners are there standing on your platform with you. This really ruins the rest of my questions too, because I have the word course platform over and over again, but so we'll get beyond that. I think we can say, I will accept your platform as I have been for the, the previous, whatever, half hour of this podcast. So, so if you're delivering a course, yeah. What are the essential like software features? Like, what does it, what does a course need to get delivered to the learners that they want to learn from it? Access to the content. That's it. Like, I mean, if you talk about like, what do you, what does it need? Like really need it, like you need to offer your stuff in a way that people can access it. So like, then what are your needs? I guess is the other side. Cause so that's pretty basic, right? So for them, they just need to have access and some way to, to kind of trot through it. So what do you need? Like as the person that's trying to deliver this to them, what, what are the essential features for you? So, so it, it sounds basic, but it enables you to do things like think about notion as a course hosting provider. Yeah. I'm a big fan. Right. Where like, okay, we're talking about my needs now. I need to be able to upload videos and I need to be able to do that in a way that isn't like, take me three hours or something like that. Cause like, that's awful. It needs to be able to like, I mean, that's it, right? You need to be able to upload your stuff and people need to be able to view it. That's the fundamental requirements of like a course platform. I think that for me, I want to be able to go beyond that. I want people to be able to like, for example, write Rust and run tests on the website without having to install Rust. And like, that's something that I can't get from Teachable. It's something I can't get from Podia, something I can't get from Notion or whatever, and it's a reason for building like a separate site, but like when it comes down to it, I don't think that anything really needs to be there other than the ability to like get the information there and the ability for people to like see the information. What about things like authorization and progress and collecting payments so you can pay the rent? I mean, all of that is dependent on like, what are you trying to achieve, right? Like you're talking about a course platform, not a subscription service that I can use to like fund everything for the year and whatnot, right? Like, do you need user accounts? Not if it's free, right? So like, it depends on what your course is, right? Is it a free leader to like other stuff that you're, then your platform is like super simple, right? It needs to be accessible. It needs to be like SEO oriented, right? And like those things change when you start thinking about how am I going to do a paid course platform or something like that, right? If you, I think you need to make decisions about like, okay, is what pieces of it is going to be accessible? Is this going to be able to hit Google at all, right? Like, is Google going to be able to bring people in for me? A lot of people just like ignore that question and default to no, right? Cause it's the easiest way to do it. At which point you need like user accounts, at which point you need like a payments and stuff, things like that, video playback is one that I'm using obviously, or I guess not obviously to listeners, but like, obviously to the person that I'm talking to on the podcast right now. I don't think that comments are like required. Cause I think that's supplemental to like, if you have a space for people to make comments like discord or something like that, you don't have to build that out, right? Like there's some sort of valve where they can go and interact with other people, maybe having a similar experience as them. Yeah. I mean, like that's a value add, if you can pull it off. Right. Not everybody wants to maintain a community. Not everybody wants to build a community. Not everybody wants to do like discord based support, stuff like that. Right. But like, if we're talking about all of the tools that you need to use to like actually build a course platform, you need to be able to respond to people's emails and you need to be able to accept payments and create user accounts. And the support load might be a big one that is often overlooked. Cause as soon as you start, I mean, exchanging products for dollars, right? Like at that point, people are going to have needs and you are going to want to meet them and especially if you're taking money, right? Like now you need to. Can you process a refund? For example, right? Like a rust adventure. I've been very lucky. It's been very successful. I've only had to process like two refunds, but I still had to process two refunds, right? Good average. I think actually that's a great metric. And I've heard this a lot, right? If you are seeing a lot of refunds, then it's like, you're either selling something and they don't understand what they're getting and it just doesn't match up to expectations. But when you, you know, like, I think that's a kudos for that. Cause that's a great metric. It's, it's one of the metrics that I think about and I'm like, yeah, most people buy the highest like version of rust adventure and I've only had to give two people refunds and like, I instantly do it, right? If somebody asked for a refund, I just give it to them. Like, there's no, like that whole aspect to it is just like, just give it. And then like, I'll, I'll ask them some questions and like, maybe they stick around and answer. Maybe they don't, but yeah. I mean, that's one of the things that I'm most sort of proud of in a way, because it means that people are buying it and then they're not looking at it and going, dang, I wish I didn't. Was there, was there anything surprising when you were building it? I know you're an extremely technical person. So, but at the same time, was, did anything kind of jump out either technically or otherwise when you were building your course delivery mechanism? How easy video was to get working. Yeah. Because the last time I seriously dealt with having to like do video was like probably flash era. It's come a long ways. Oh, and then like the HTML5 video element came around and then it really wasn't usable, right? Yeah. It's still not, it's not YouTube, right? Is the way that I'll put it. But it's something that like people have, there are players out there and there are services out there to deliver the video. And like, I didn't have to build the video delivery infrastructure. If I think if I had to build video delivery infrastructure, like, I don't know, RTMP shit or like something like that, that would have been like, Ooh, do I really want to do this? That would have been a moment at which like, okay, can I sacrifice like building my own thing and go like do something half on Teachable half somewhere else or something like that? Or like Teachable just uses Wistia. I've heard of Wistia. I have not used it. They're a delivery platform and they're basically marketing. And they actually, when we build Egghead, Chris, the CEO of Wistia is an amazing person and just gave it to us for free. Which at the time video delivery was a real pain in the butt and it's improved a lot since then, but gave it to us for free is great. But like that's Teachable did not build their own video delivery infrastructure. That's the point, right? Like, and they're, they're a multi-billion dollar company and they did not. They avoided that sticky wicket and left it to, you know, people that are, it's like video delivery infrastructure, global CDNs and email. These are problems that I am super happy to allow companies to handle. I mean, if you ask me the set of technologies I'm using or like what I actually built, it's very small. Like it's probably smaller than you think it is. This is like, I want to hear that. Sure. The actual stuff that I actually built, I happened to have been building a framework myself for the past year or something called Toast. And I knew that what I wanted was to not have to worry about actively running servers as much as possible. So ton of it is just pre-rendered through Toast. And I use that for all of the content and stuff like that. You can get to all of the Rust adventure stuff via Google. All of the writing, all of the blog posts, all of the stuff like that. You cannot access the videos, but you can access all of the written content. And like that's, short aside, that's really important to me. It's really important for me to like give access to people who actually need it and are willing to go through a little bit more effort to get at it. So speaking, you could probably get a lot of the information, if not most, just by, by spelunking and doing a little bit of legwork and discovering it in text form. So some, you lose some convenience, but the meat of it is still there. Yeah. I think for me, like the curation and all of that is like valuable to pay for. And like, if you want me to do more of it, like I need the money. So like at some point buy it. But like, I remember being a young programmer or whatever, and not being able to afford any of this stuff. So like, it's really important to me to make it accessible to people who actually need it, even if it's not like everything, even if it's not like perfect, even if they don't have the user account or whatever. So that's basically all of that is statically rendered and just like up there. It's hard to get to. Also easier technically, right? Like you don't have to even think about how you're going to protect it or hide it or prevent people from sneaking glimpses. It's just like, it doesn't matter. It's just there. I had somebody submit, like to try to get a security bounty for like, Hey, we can access your content. And I was like, feature. So yeah, I mean, that's really all I built. And then I built some like serverless functions to handle various things. But like everything else is a Mux for video delivery. Mux is integration for video player and analytics and stuff like that. And then the payments are Stripe checkout. The user authentication is Cognito and stuff like that. So like there's like, I'm not building the infrastructure myself. I'm building the kind of like, kind of why I call it like a product and not like a platform that we were talking before, because it's a thing for me built on top of a bunch of platforms and infrastructure, right? Like AWS to me definitively platform, like it's powering so many other businesses. Right. So like I'm standing on top of those things and like the amount of stuff that I actually did for Rust Adventure, like I'm hosting all my repos on GitHub and they're all open source, by the way. So like, if you are a person who wants to dig and access the stuff, you can get access to the stuff. Like the code is there. All of the blog posts are even in the commits. So if you clone the repo, you get access. I recently saw somebody else on Twitter talking about like somebody tried to translate their course or whatever and posted a translation and they were like, can you take that down? And like, you know, like I would be concerned about that getting out of date and stuff and they're like, there are reasons that I would not want it spread around in the way that it's being spread around there, but like when it comes down to it, if it makes it more accessible to people, I think in the end it's all a positive because in the end people want to pay for content that helps them. People want to support people who are helping them get done what they need to get done with their life. I don't think that needs to be a thing that I need to worry about. Right. The occasional person who like might've would've paid for it might get it like, Oh, well, I'm still making plenty off of it. There's useful convenience to having the user account. There's useful convenience to getting access to the videos. There's useful convenience to me being able to continue to do this thing that you are benefiting from. And I think that drives basically everything about RustAdventure at this point. The only line that we've ever drawn, cause it's just silly and it's hard to combat and, and often fruitless and frustrating, the only like, sometimes we'll get people wholesale uploading to YouTube and we make the effort to have that pulled down from YouTube because it feels like it should be free. Like if you, the people that are consuming it, don't know that they're. Consuming it in a way that they shouldn't like pirate sites. I don't worry about cause everybody that's on a pirate site knows exactly what they're doing and they're not your customers anyway, so I don't really care what you're doing cause you're just stealing from yourselves. But like when it goes up on YouTube wholesale, I'm like, okay, well I'll do the, I have a script that builds the spreadsheet that YouTube requires to have that sort of thing removed and that is, that's like the line for me, but like, there's, you know, like I agree with you, like if somebody is doing a translation, maybe can I just pay you for that and we'll put it on the official channels, like that sort of thing. Right. Like that. And then I find a way to keep it updated or something rather than have it go out of date and whatnot. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, like this is a need that people have, so maybe we can just service that need instead of, of fighting it or wanting it to go away. I think the, the really easy example of this that I just saw recently is Nintendo just took down, I don't know, a bunch of stuff off of one of these like music reupload channels for like Mario Kart theme songs and stuff like that, but they don't have it up on their own channel, so nobody can listen to it. Right. Like that to me is the line. Like if you're going to reupload it, well, I mean, like if it's, all of my stuff is on YouTube anyway, you can go through and view all of like the early content, early versions of the content, all of the stuff as I was figuring everything out, it's all on YouTube. It's all freely available. It's all there. Yeah. I mean, like I stream a lot of it. Right. So like, I don't know. I would prefer people get it from the source that like people credit me and stuff like that. That's kind of what I care about. Like I did the stuff and don't re-upload it under your name and then not let it get back to me. Like don't cut me out of the equation and then try to resell it. That's a line for me. But like, but I want people to have access. It's important. I think we, we share that desire. This is the last question. And I'm curious what your answer will be. Do you have any audacious goals in terms of, of your teaching or course development or the course delivery mechanisms that you have employed? Audacious goals. Like I said, I have some stuff that I'm working on currently where you will be able to like run Rust on the site in the course to like do that language level kind of stuff. Oh, cool. You can't really do that for like CLIs and stuff. I mean, like you could, but like, it doesn't have the same impact. Like you can't run a game on the website through compiling it for somewhere else or whatever. It doesn't really make sense to do that. But for like Rustlings, like almost exorcism-y type stuff, like language levels, syntax, and small exercise, those are all going to be like, you can write some Rust in the browser and run it and run the tests and get the feedback. Building that? Yes. That is a thing that I currently have in prototype mode. So that should be coming at some point. It'll probably come out like as I start shipping the language stuff on the site. Right now, a lot of the language level content is going to YouTube because I have ideas of how it should be presented, but I want to make sure that they are the ones that should go into the workshop on the site and that's going to be like free leader content because I don't think that the language level stuff, I think there's so much language level stuff for Rust out there that it doesn't really make sense for me to like charge for that. But it makes a lot of sense for me to like have that be a thing. Right. It's your perspective and it'll be like a direct conduit into like, this is how we are going to do things here. So you can, it's like a primer at that point, I would think. Yeah, for sure. And then there's also like, I don't just do Rust, right? And like, I never really have just done JavaScript either. And I have wider vision around like, yeah, so I do a bunch of serverless stuff for Rust, but if I have already done all of the instructional design for like the serverless side of it, then it's less work for me to do that also for JavaScript or something, right? Like something else I have expertise in. So when you have a serverless course on the market, will you then have a platform? I'm just teasing, call it what you will, it's fine. I really appreciate it, Chris. Thanks for sharing your experience and I think it's great what you're doing. It sounds like if people are interested in Rust, following you on YouTube would probably be a really good idea. And then maybe exploring Rust adventures. Thanks again. Yeah. Thanks for having me. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"You are talented and interesting and we've worked together on Egghead and it's been like a pleasure to watch you go from an intern at a company to a professional software developer and educator and sharing your knowledge. And that's something that I personally enjoyed watching. And we're going to talk about some of that. And specifically, we're going to talk about the course platform and course that you're developing. But the first thing I wanted to kind of kick it off with was how do you approach learning a new complex topic? Like when you sit down to learn something, it's difficult, you know, you have a hill to climb, how do you approach learning something complex? I think for me, my, my best learning is done by doing, which I don't think is totally unique, but I feel like I hit walls when I'm trying to learn something and I, I spin wheels just kind of reading or memorizing, or it was the same thing for me in school, like going through university where I felt like I didn't learn until I did homework. So most of the time in class, I'd sit there and do my homework while the teacher was lecturing, because I felt like I could actually connect the dots that way. And so that leads me to where, yeah, when I'm interested in doing something, I have to look up a lot of info, kind of do a lot of reading, that's like a preliminary step, but I don't feel like it's ultimately learned until I've like done something with the knowledge. And, you know, if it's something physical using my hands and actually like touching and feeling, if it's, you know, writing code, which I do a lot of and trying to learn some new tool, library or language, then I think I have to build something and it can't really even be something trivial either. It almost has to be something that I like intend to use. So I feel like I build a lot of small trinkets and gadgets and tools that have really helped solidify the things I actually feel like I learn and get better at, but yeah. Do you, do you reach for books or what's your research process like when you, you said you, you read a lot and I'm wondering, you know, like a lot, like there's the web and there's books and there's different ways to think about reading and research and I'm wondering, what does that process look like? I think I read a lot. I do read a lot of books. I feel like I, I want to consume from multiple mediums or multiple media, whatever the plural of that is. So yeah, if it's books, I feel like maybe it depends on what I'm trying to learn, what I'll reach for. When it's cooking, I'm happy to watch a YouTube video because I can see somebody doing something and you know, I can mimic the behavior. I feel like when it's a more like complex thing that I feel like will take a deeper dive, I want to, I want to hear what like four or five people have to say about something and that could be reading books, blog posts. Are you much of a course taker? Do you buy like online courses and take them or watch them or read them or do them? Yeah. Yeah. I am definitely, and I feel like the value I get out of courses ends up being like, there's a couple gems in each one. You know, I think I'm also not unique in that I buy a lot and don't finish a lot of them because I, I don't know. Finishing is always the, always right. I mean, it's finishing the goal, right? Like it's what you want to get what you need out of it, not necessarily finish the course. Right. Totally. Like same thing with the book. Like I don't finish tons of books. I don't think unless they're like fantasy books, I want to get to the end, but I tend to like read to get the ideas I feel like I was there for, and once I feel satisfied with those, like move on to the next thing and, and yeah, I'm kind of like antsy to try. I was going to say, what are the, like the qualities of a really good course? When you take one and you're like, wow, that was great. What are some of the qualities that you've noticed? Um, the, I, I really noticed like the small details and I think it's like really intentional thought into the content. I mean, the content is really what I'm there for. And if it's been well thought out, I feel like there's like a logical flow of ideas where I can start at the beginning, go to the next thing and it kind of like piece together, like, like I'm following. Like building a Lego and it's step one, step two, step three, there's complex ideas that aren't like numeric steps, but I think a good course, like somebody that really knows the material can turn it into something that almost becomes that for you, where it's like step one. It's like, oh yeah, that's easy. Step two. Oh yeah, that's easy. I just take one and add two. Oh, step three. So if I like take a course and I, and I feel like, oh yeah, this is kind of easy. I think it's done its job for me. And that maybe is different by every, the level of the learner taking a course, but when I'm following something, if I like feel smart doing it, I think maybe it's stroking my ego a little, but it, I think it also shows that like an expert has made something complex, simple, and really knows what they're doing. So you've built UI foundations and it's a design course specifically focused on building beautiful UIs and that's what you're teaching folks how to do. And when somebody comes to that, when a learner comes to UI foundations and they're interested in what you have to offer, what are they trying to achieve? What do you feel like is the difference in their lives that they're trying to accomplish? I would hope that somebody who comes to UI foundations, kind of like the target audience of what I've been building for is almost like the vague ambiguous parts of design that you almost like can't point at and like we can point a homepage of a website and say like, Oh yeah, that looks good. But it's almost hard to like quantify why. I think what I'm hoping people learn as, as they go through the content and can like interact with it is that there's stuff that you kind of can't quantify. There's like rules that you can and lines in the sand you can draw that is like, this is good most of the time with some caveats always in design because it's an And if you follow this, like you're probably going to end up looking pretty good and if you follow this, you're going to, this is a good input to your output. If you kind of take these inputs and understand some rules about like how colors work together and how spacing and, you know, contrast and all sorts of these like design principles that kind of make like little pieces, it's almost like trying to arm learners with, with a bunch of, I mean, I named it foundations because I think that it's like pretty fundamental stuff, it's not like super new and novel, a lot of like the design principles I'm trying to like teach, but I'm trying to make them like practical and give like some actual opinions and rules to say like, do this, don't do this. And if you do, I'm willing to bet what you come out with, if you're trying to design something yourself, will look pretty good, so. I think one of the cool things that you've done is created this kind of interactive environment where you're not just, it's not a book and it's not a video course, but you've given people an environment where they kind of can get in there and touch and feel the design process in a way that feels pretty, pretty real. And I'm wondering, you know, like how has that approach helping people achieve their goals and why have you kind of chosen to take that extra effort to make those interactive examples? Yeah, I think for me, it felt like a pretty natural fit to say that if I'm teaching design, it's, you know, you can look at it, you can see it, you can see a design that's good and I can look at a design and I can see that it's bad. And there's like this in-between state, like how do I take it from bad to good? And one of like the most common interactive things I have throughout like the course is this like little example pane that I have where I put like a UI inside it and I like throw some bullet points next to it. And when you click a button, it'll animate from like a bad state to a good one. And it's not necessarily always like bad and good. That's, it's kind of subjective, but there's like that ground in between a bad design and a good design where people throw up their hands when they're looking at something and say like, why does it look good? Like, what's my problem here? And if you have a book, you can kind of show like a good and bad side by side, but sometimes it's not always clear exactly, you know, it's almost like you play the game of like circle the differences between these two examples. And I'm almost like playing the game for you when you click a button and can kind of animate the difference between good and bad and emphasize some text and put some more color in somewhere. And then you realize like, oh, a different shade of tinted background actually like breathes some life into this. And all I need to add was that one thing. And I hope, and my goal, and it seems to resonate and land with a lot of people is that it makes it a lot like faster to kind of digest and get the gist of when you can see, okay, here's where we started. Here's where we ended. It does look better. And there wasn't all that much that had to change. It was a little tweak here. And then I just kind of categorize those into different rules and principles. And yeah. I noticed that you don't, cause in the ones, in the examples that I played with, it wasn't like good or bad. It was like less and more. So you're adding more to it and maybe this is too much and this is too little. And then there's kind of that Goldilocks in the middle where it's, this is the sweet spot, but like based on preference, you could move it a little bit this way or a little bit this way, and you're not going to ruin it, but you can, when you're at the extremes and it's, you know, like, that's not probably it. Right. And it pops back into the middle. And I really enjoyed that. Like, I thought that was a thoughtful touch. Cool. Yeah. I'm glad, I'm glad you did. How do you know when somebody is interacting with your site or they're a learner is going through the course. Do you have any way to know when they've been successful? Have you, I know you're still very in progress with this, but like what have you learned so far in terms of learner success and people going through it? I really wish I, this is something I've been thinking about and I think I need to find a better mechanism for gauging it. I have some like pretty rudimentary tracking inside of it, just to say like when stuff is marked as complete, I have, I have like some analytics in the background where I can kind of look at, I have some like quizzes inside there and kind of see when people are marking the wrong answers, almost like a teacher could kind of check a bunch of tests and see the grade distribution on like a particular question. So I would hope that those are over time going to lead me to say like, Oh, apparently this content leading up to this question didn't explain it in a way that led people to the right answer most of the time. So I think that's going to be very interesting over time as more and more people go through the content and kind of interact with it, I have had like a pretty one-on-one lines of communication channels with a couple of people going through that have, you know, I've just sat down and talked about their feedback and gotten responses about what they liked, didn't like that, that won't be scalable in the long run, but I really don't have what I feel like is a good mechanism to say they made it through and it was worth their money and I think that's a failure on my part. I hope that by the end they get to a certain point, but I don't feel like I have a great way of measuring that yet that I've quite landed on. I wouldn't call it a failure, Kyle. I would say like you're in a learning process yourself, right? Like, I think that's what's interesting because you are creating something and you're selling it, but you're also learning as you go, right? Like this is your first course and course platform, correct? Like you haven't created course platforms in the past and this is kind of an effort. And I think that's great. You said you were talking to people like learners as they go through in a handful of them. How has that feedback affected what you've made, if it has at all? It's made me realize that I apparently can't proofread my own work because there's a lot of issues in there. First thing I've learned. Apart from that, I've realized that, you know, everybody really is different stuff that resonates with some people, doesn't with others, like things that I've sometimes have gone through like three or four iterations on some of these little like examples I've made that I've kind of embedded inside blocks of texts to make stuff more interactive. And some people just say like, you know, I didn't really get this one. I thought it looked about the same between both states, right? I didn't quite get the point. And yeah, it's a little bit harder than I thought, where sometimes the things in my head, I don't quite get out into the right format to explain it well or right. And that's been a challenge. I think for sure there's a big variety of people that have kind of signed up in little like pre-release period that come from kind of different backgrounds. And I think it was a bit of a, at first I was almost like firing darts at the wall of like what kind of developer or designer I was targeting, if it was really more developers and more designers. And I think I've landed somewhere in the middle and those people come with different backgrounds and I've assumed some knowledge in places that, you know, a different kind of learner just doesn't have and needs to like, I need to give more context some places, but not give too much context to bore other people. And a lot of those things have become challenges, but they're interesting challenges and they, I've liked having my own course platform to find nice ways to solve them where I can hide context inside tool tips and dropdowns and you know, let people skip content when they need to. And yeah, you get that, you get that control. Yeah. Hard to fire wide, but great to have the control to know that I can like adjust the levers where I need to. Do you have any sort of approach to instructional design that you've been taking or is it just kind of taking your knowledge and applying it? I don't think I've really had much of a framework for thinking. I think a lot of it's been a bit of like intuition I've started gaining from like writing docs and tutorials and content and stuff like that over time. And yeah, I've kind of trusted my gut that the stuff that I've learned well with other people will hopefully resonate with and followed an approach where I try and deliver things a couple ways. And with like a couple examples, I would say that's like one kind of core philosophy of trying to follow is rehashing stuff a couple of ways, you know, introducing a principle in the first module and then a couple of modules later, kind of bringing it back up to like nail it home, like this is where that idea and this idea synthesize. And then, yeah, hopefully having enough good examples that, you know, something sticks. You touched on this a little bit and I'm really curious, why not use an existing platform like a Teachable or a Podia or something that you could just go and you didn't have to bother with all the kind of technical stuff in terms of your own platform? I considered it, but I think part of the thing that I love most, and I think the thing that the really like the killer feature, the thing that I feel like is most valuable about what I've been building is that it, it can be, there can be a lot more in a little, like less can be more in, in what I'm able to build where I've done like screencasts and I've written long form content and stuff where you can embed things and it's good. And you can explain things. Well, I don't think it's a bad approach, but I, I felt like all of the design content and things that like I had learned from like blog posts on medium, YouTube channels that teach this stuff, like websites with, you know, this kind of content. It, I learned almost more like tweaking around with like color tools on the internet than I have, like reading a blog post about color theory. And I felt like there was some hybrid of it that I couldn't get like building on Teachable or just recording a bunch of videos and, you know, putting them wherever that I hoped would make the. Like the learning journey a little bit more, it's kind of like a bit, the egghead idea of like, let's make it short to the point and respect the time of the person learning. I, I think that you can learn a lot more with one really nicely done example with some knobs you can tweak because you know, I get to put as the learner, I get to adjust the knobs. I get to look at the things that I don't understand and be like, well, what does that change? And move a slider one way and watches like this graph changes and, and teaches you something. And some of the knobs I can ignore in a video. I feel like you have to watch every single one of the knobs be turned and four out of the five knobs already knew what they did. And by the time I get to the fifth, I'm bored of the video. So I think in that regard, it puts you in control a little bit as you're going through. And I didn't feel like I could get like a super fine grained controller, like a handle on that, unless I did it myself, which is, you know, like maybe the following. It gives you just the full control and right. Well, I mean, you can, so that, that's one thing because you have the technical capabilities to do it. So I did it cause I can, it's actually a pretty, pretty solid answer in general, but then you get complete control and you're able to design something more, more related to your customers and the vision you have of teaching them. That, that sums it up pretty well. Has there been any surprising challenge like technical or otherwise, as you've built your platform and delivered it that you've run into, or has it all been pretty ordinary for you? Technical challenge. I don't think I've run into anything too like surprising. There have been small challenges in places where I start putting my engineering hat on and go too far in the weeds on how to start building tools to fix my other tools. I've tried to keep it simple. I knew that I would get distracted if I spent too much time building the platform versus writing the content. And so I've definitely cut some corners intentionally knowing that I would get off topic if I spent too much time building platform, too little time building content. And so that's something you've had to be consciously aware of too. I assume, like how do you balance that? What's the balance between I need to make progress cause the course is in, in flight and you're building a platform. So how do you balance that when you sit down to work? Yeah. When I sit down, I think it helps me that a lot of the content I'm building is like very invigorating, like technical work. Like the examples I'm trying to build are, are fun interactions that sometimes are like kind of math heavy and that engages my brain the same way building a platform would. And yeah, I definitely spend a lot more time building content now. I wanted to get the platform just to a point of saying, let's somebody pay for it, log in and click next, next, next, and go all the way through. And I achieved that and then have really put minimal effort back into fleshing out some pieces of the course that I would really like to, I'd love to go like design a nice splashy landing page for each module and some fun, cool icons that animate and go with it. That's what my brain wants to work on, but I don't think that's the most important part and just by the nature of the content, it sounds like you're scratching some of your brain's desires by, cause it's technical. Yeah. What are some of the, you know, like thinking about just platform features that you would love to have? What would you add to it if you could snap your fingers today? I would love to have a lot of really great interactive courses I've followed have embedded programming inside it with like little exercises because the nature of the stuff I'm teaching isn't too closely related to that. I haven't bothered to, yeah, I think I could have benefited from it in some places, but I've also tried to like keep the foundational goal. Like, you know, a lot of these people coming in here won't be people that are writing code or want to know how to write code. They may tangentially glance off the surface of like some HTML and CSS. Developing websites and stuff, or, you know, interacting with web developers, but it's not everyone though. I think exposing people to that could still be very powerful. So I would have loved to have some good tooling. If there was something I could just install that got a lot of that done where I could have a program exercise. So not to spoil it, but you should check out Sandpack. Yeah. I've started looking and yeah, I. Not to ruin your weekend, but. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing. It's like, I couldn't look too close because I knew like, oh brother, I'm going to, I'm going to spend another weekend building tool, not running. Sandpack is from the people that make CodeSandbox and it's an embedded code tool that you can kind of pop into these sorts of things and it's pretty cool. And just for anybody that was curious about that one, but it is a rabbit hole. It isn't a snap your fingers, but it is very cool. Right, right. Yeah. So what is the tech stack? How did you build this? What went into like tech, technologically speaking, what has gone into building, building your core? I would say the secret sauce was, I mean, MDX I feel like is the most important piece I can have markdown content. That's pretty easy to author where I can drop in react components I want. And write whatever react I want to drop in, which is really great. And I've been able to do some really nice, nice things that make it really easy to author great examples, thing, render things side by side, render things that can animate. And that helps me like kind of build it fast and make a lot of these examples. I feel like the other key piece that makes it, made it possible. I saw like super base early on was catching some eyes and it looked like it delivered a lot of things that I wanted, which was basically really easy authentication and gated content and a database managed for me and yeah. So that I think I got like a super base instance set up in like a couple hours and had an app I could log into. And I was like, great. That was one of the biggest pieces I needed. It's a wonderful product. Handles a lot of that for me. It is it. I've been really impressed and it started become this evangelist for it. When I see people need help on Twitter, I'm like, let me tell you, that's great. It's really good. And yeah. Are you using any sort of no code D visual kind of programming tools to run any of this? Not right now. No, I, yeah, I've considered some kind of like no Cody tools to build some like tooling for me, like maybe hooking up some like feedback gathering or, you know, potentially like managing some like of a, the customer business-y type stuff, but nothing to help like actually develop the course yet. Yeah. I think the closest I saw when I went through it and purchased the, what, maybe like gumroad, I guess, where you're going in there is for like this actual sales component that would count. It wasn't like a direct stripe integration or something. And it seemed like it would be pretty smooth. Yeah. No, take it, take hours instead of days to implement. Yeah, that's true. You could probably consider that. Yeah. The payment processing. That's another important piece. I actually spent a while waffling on that. Yeah. And you can go a lot of different directions too in varied complexity, right. When you want to start going down that road. Yeah. Yeah. I started with Stripe and ended up migrating to gumroad to allay the tax burden and just, you know, be done with it, but definitely went down some rabbit holes there and I'm hoping that I don't have to go out on them again. Well, Kyle, I got to say I'm your target audience. I've really enjoyed it. I've actually learned and spent a little bit of time with the course and learned a lot, and I really appreciate you putting it together and taking the time out to chat with me today. Thank you so much. Yeah, you bet. Thanks. Appreciate that a lot. It's been a pleasure talking with you. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm really excited to talk to you. You've built an amazing learning platform, I think, that takes a kind of a unique approach to the technical aspects of platform building, both from the platform itself, like what you've built as a business, and then as learners and kind of enabling people to do things that they otherwise couldn't do. I wanted to kind of break the ice and ask you, when you approach a difficult new topic, what's your strategy? How do you think about learning on the internet or otherwise? Yeah, I think I'm just one of those people that do not read instructions. I will just try and figure it out. So I'd often just jump into something and then try and refer back to something when it ultimately hasn't worked, which happens often when you don't read instructions. So I'm a sort of like darter and diver into, okay, there's like a text-based tutorial here, or there's a YouTube clip here, just skip it straight to where I need to be and find out that piece. And then I think lots of it is like how someone else done it and actually just asking people, because often you can find them on Twitter and stuff about like, how'd you build that thing? Or where's that from? And actually things like, this is one thing that I was looking at Egghead for years when I was building Makepad. So I just stole all my site features from other sites and all the design and everything. Yeah, I'm all about that. That's the way to go. Yeah, definitely. So I remember looking at the Egghead pricing page and I was like, I love how it was just so simple. And I was like, use extensions like built with and whatever, just to see if there's anything I could steal. So I'll try and like dive in that way with certain things like that. It's funny, because I've done the same thing with MakerPad for some of the things that you've done. Like, and I think that's cool. And like, I would encourage people to do that, right? Like go out and actually seek out a way, instead of inventing everything from whole cloth every time, like what works. And it's not like a cut and paste or outright plagiarism or theft. It's just like, well, this looks pretty good. I like this and it's working. So like, why not jump to the finish line instead of starting from scratch? Yeah, and also with like bigger companies, you assume that they've done all the testing. They figured out what the thing actually, like what that sort of page needs to look like because they've got resources. Whereas if you're a small business or a one man band building stuff, like lean on what other people are doing and what's working. So I think, yeah, they probably figure it out. I would warn people that like copying what we've done is probably not gonna fit that particular description you just put out there. But, you know, I think it still stands. So you have your personal learning style and then you sit down and you know, like you're a teacher and an educator on the internet. How does your personal learning style differ from like the way you approach like creating curriculum? Well, most of our content is video based. And I just told you that I prefer text based or I would like a mixture of, yeah, I like a mixture. Yeah, why is it that we've done that then? If we've done both the same thing and think the same, but actually recently we've started making sure that everything also has the transcription. And then I've tried to tone down tutorials where I think early on a couple of years ago would have been, I'll show you, click here to set up an account, click this button to do this, and you just, you get to a point where I think if you're on the other side, do you wanna, do you need to see someone like create an account on this tool? Do you need to see that? Can you just assume some level of common sense and sort of tech proficiency when using a website? But sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's interesting to think about that level of assumption too because you're always kind of catering and it's like, there's this, do we have to go back to square one every time we teach something? Or can we assume people understand login with Google or whatever the mechanism might be and they can kind of jump to pass this account creation bit. And that, I mean, video, like people obviously love it, right? Like YouTube exists and this, and Netflix and just video is something that we all love and consume, but it's like a teaching style thing or how we like to consume or just the, almost like a preference. Like for me, I can watch video on 2X and enjoy it. But if it does not have 2X, it's like, I'm not even going to sit down with it. And I don't know if that's impatience or what, but like the medium itself is aggravating to me just because of sheer speed where text, I can just scan and kind of jump to what I want and visually map it out or whatever, like pattern matching. Yeah, no, I'm definitely, I'm exactly the same with video, especially on YouTube. If I'm looking for a recipe to cook something, I like, I open the transcripts of the YouTube video because I think every YouTube video automatically has one now. And you can just skip to those bits and then scrub through and all, miss all these sort of fluff bits that you actually don't need. How do you describe MakerPad as a platform? I think it's changed every three, six months, probably. It started as a learning community for want-to-be founders, want-to-be entrepreneurs. We're a little unique in that we teach like no code and no code as a term has become semi-popular over the last couple of years. I don't know if we had anything to do with that, but if we did, I would have chosen something, a different term for it. So it's difficult because if we want to say MakerPad is the place to learn no code, you've automatically alienated everyone who's never heard of no code. And people, I think if we're trying to reach the everyday people, which I think we are, like my mom wouldn't type in how to build a website with code or without code in Google. She would just type how to build a website. So there are things that we're constantly playing with and thinking around, well, you can build projects, you can build a business, you can automate work. You don't have to code. And it's just, there's not like a really catchy one-liner in there that we really love and think that we own. So yeah, I mean, there'll be another one out on our homepage in a few weeks, I'm sure. So I'll message you about that one. So I'm a code maximalist, right? Like I will spin up and build a full stack backend. And to me, like this idea of no or low code or like whatever you wanna describe it is, it's almost like a stepping stone and just a smart way to go about things that saves time and kind of removes a lot of technical complexity. Because frankly, no code is a misnomer. Like it's like as a user, it's no code, but there is a ton of code actually getting run behind the scenes. And I was talking to Quincy Larson, he's talking about the future where it's Star Trek and you're the captain on the deck and you just ask the computer to do something and it happens. And like that kind of future is actually pretty interesting to me where we've democratized this ability to create or build something and you don't have to have learned how to program computers at a syntax level. And like I assume that's kind of the goal, right? Like we wanna build something, we wanna get it out there in the world and not have to learn JavaScript to be able to produce anything at all. Yeah, I think it's just, it's an abstraction, right? So it's just not touching the actual code. You're just touching a UI layer on top of that, that ultimately creates the same code that a developer might when they're spinning up a similar site. And like you said, there's a lot of, or there has been conversations around code versus no code, but that's like, that's completely missing the point. I think it's, they're all on the same spectrum of creating software, creating something with software, whereas no, like the no code bit is just the very, very beginning of the really entry level stuff. And then as you graduate, you start playing with webhooks and APIs and things like that. And then it's a very like easy slope into actually, you wanna now write a script for your site. You wanna now like start doing that. And then you start learning, you can start learning code that way quite easily. I think I've seen many people doing that, especially on like the advanced, when they need to push it a bit further, which I'm sure we'll get onto. Yeah, I didn't say there's a one versus the other. Yeah, it's just an abstraction. When somebody comes to, like a learner comes to MakerPad, what kind of difference are they generally seeking in their lives? Have you noticed patterns? Like what are they trying to accomplish or what difference are they trying to achieve? It definitely was the people who were told, oh yeah, cool idea, you should go like learn to code or go find a technical co-founder. It's generally what the sort of ideas people usually are in the conversation of, let's start a startup. Hey, you talk to your friend and say, I've got a really good idea for a startup. I'm not technical. I'm not sure how to build it. I'll go to an agency or whatever. It's like sort of at that point, no code to me should be the first thought of thing to do. I've got this idea. It's basically behind the hood, exactly like Airbnb. There's a form, there's a email sequence. There's like a UI where you can filter stuff. The first thing shouldn't be, I need to save $100,000 to hire a developer to do it. It shouldn't be, I'll start learning to code. In nine months, I'll be able to build a really shitty version of this. It should be, let me just spin this up and see what it looks like and how it could actually work. So I think it's like what we said before with copying or borrowing features and things from other companies, lots of websites could be grouped into very similar mechanics, right? Like Egghead and Makepad could broadly be put into the same category of a learning platform. Yours is built with code. Ours is built with no code. They still do similar things or have similar features. Obviously, we don't have as advanced features, but it's still like I can spin that up quite quickly and it's the same for most ideas, really. It took me six years to learn how to program computers, not nine months before I was able to do something like Egghead. So I think that's a good point. And it's interesting to me because over time, we've actually migrated away from the code maximalists and used more kind of no low-code tools because our entire team isn't multi-decade experienced programmers and it's like if they want to add to it or build it, it's like it opens it up to them as well, which is another kind of interesting advantage of just these services, because they're taking patterns, right? Like I assume, and that's what we're talking about is these patterns. Here's the general shape of a learning platform. So we can combine these services and you get that shape and you're going to end up with some customizations maybe that you can't do or need to expand on, but you can get to that MVP, right? Like this point of being able to produce something and ship it into the world without needing all that kind of overhead up front and actually see if people are interested, because I think that's a big, like the underlying theme too, is like if you build something and nobody cares and you've wasted $100,000 and two years of your life making something that nobody's even interested in, that's a different discussion, but it's also, it hurts pretty severely to do that and it happens all the time. Yeah, I think that's an interesting thing that I've been thinking about where I don't know if no-code is sort of a two-sided coin in that conversation because I could build something in an afternoon or a weekend, ship it on a Monday, no one gave a shit all week and everyone gave terrible feedback and said, this is awful, like you need to change this. I'd had that weekend's worth of emotional attachment to that project, whereas if I was coding something for six years, I'd be saying this has to work, like, or you're 200 grand in with a development team, you're thinking this has to work and you're then going to not quickly pivot or be more open to feedback, you're probably gonna be thinking, no, no, this is, the idea I built was this, this needs to work, no matter if the market would tell you differently. So that's like, you can give up on those projects quite easily, but again, I think to be a successful entrepreneur, there is a perseverance, but also you probably need to be a bit clued up and like seeing the signs either way, it's like, is this worth persevering or do I need to change this? Have you noticed people's kind of worldviews or how they approach problems, changing as they come into MakerPad and go through your curriculum and come out of the other side, how have people changed in practice? Yeah, so we do like a survey as they come in, we have a cohort course, I'm sure we'll get on to, so we do a survey at the start saying things like, how confident are you with knowing what tools to build your idea, if you have an idea, what tools you need to build them or coming up with those ideas or knowing how to put them together or like building them and actually putting them out in the open. And the scores change pretty dramatically from when they come in to when they finish, because we try and make people ship, like ship shit stuff, like that's what we say, just build crap, like just build anything, because you need to have those reps and that feeling of, I've put something together, I've put it out there, cool, like that's not gonna go anywhere, a recipe book of just my family meals isn't gonna go gangbusters on the internet, but like I've done it, I've gone through the motions, I sort of understand how to like put them together and then do all that stuff, so then that just becomes a bit of a muscle you start training I suppose, where developers are probably, that's how a lot of them learn as well, you like you build small little chunks of projects over time and then you can put that all together, so that's what we're trying to teach is, it's not actually that scary to do it, but I think lots of people, they probably use a ton of things as excuses to even start that building thing, so we're trying to get over that too of like, no, I've got this one idea I wanna build, so no one wants to do that, so you just don't want it to fail and they could build it, but they're just too scared and I think saying, okay, well, if you think that is your big business idea, I mean, we've seen it from the other side, but like if that's what you think, come up with five or 10 other ones before it, before you get to that, to building that last one then, because that'll change definitely. And like iterating through the process, getting to the end through maybe a more incremental, have you had any like surprise success stories come out of Megapad students where it's just they did something unexpected or otherwise succeeded beyond their own expectations? Yeah, there was a woman in one of our cohorts called Cindy and I hope she doesn't mind if she listens to this, me telling her story, but she's a really like sweet older lady who came and joined one of our cohorts and was like, I have no idea what NoCode is, what any of the tools are, anything, like I don't know any of this. And then she started getting through the cohort and really engaging, really like committing to learning this stuff, building stuff and sharing with the group and everything else so that was awesome to see. And then she joined our last cohort as like a returning student and like in the middle of it, she was like, oh yeah, I wrote this script to get this thing going. And I was like, wait, Cindy, you've like, you've written a script, I can't even write a script. Yeah, I was like, where, that transformation has been like, that's just crazy. That's literally gone from zero to writing your own script for your own website. So that to me, I was just like, that's crazy. I never thought we- That's like a whole world of opportunity too, right? Like that's completely changed the like roadmap of what they can produce. It's like a new superpower at the end of the day. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah. And I think there's lots of things like that. There's a couple of people who sort of collaborated together then they started launching products. One of them was like number one on product turn and all of these types of things that are like, I think for big business people, it's like they seem like small wins and they are small wins. But I think you need, I mean, I must have had 50 product launches under my belt before anything really actually stuck. So I think you need those wins, however small or big to get there really. So you mentioned cohorts and I think there's a lot of different ways you can approach like participation, like active learner participation. And like on Egghead, it's totally self-paced. Go in there and you watch it like Netflix and then there's like live workshops and cohort based and what y'all have focused on cohort based and how has that contributed to the success of learners coming into MakerPad? I think it's really difficult because I think cohort based courses had or are having their moment. In a world of everyone is stuck at home on Zoom, people wanted like a connection. So I think it all timed very nicely with, oh, I've got a cohort and I've got a cohort and I've got a cohort and I've never done one. So when we started to say, well, we'll just teach one and we'll see what goes and we'll learn from that. And I think we're on our sixth one now and they are interesting. I don't know, like I can't tell which is my favorite like path of education to have as a business. I can't, I don't know if it's self-paced because there's all the talk about non-completion rates and all of that stuff or whether I like the live element because like sometimes it's up to the group whether how successful that cohort is. If that cohort are happy to be quiet and not share and not really wanna like dive in like Cindy did, then it can be a lot quieter. And it's a hard job. It's very taxing to like do a five week cohort, be sort of the entertainer every session and go get people in and go do icebreakers. You're gonna like try and force that connection straight away. So they're interesting, but the people who do commit to them get so much out of them like Cindy that you can't argue with that. I don't know if she would have got there had it not been for the live cohorts. Like when it works and you have active participatory learners like that's where the magic happens and you can get something really special and kind of evolve out of that. But if it's a bunch of people that aren't really into it, then it probably is just, it's almost sad at that point I would think or just difficult, right? Like it's just hard to get a room of people that don't wanna talk to talk and opening that up. And I think there's a challenge in facilitating too. And I liken it to Dungeons and Dragons a lot of times where you have to, the game master, the person running it, that's setting up the module, doing the research and showing up and getting everybody else interested is like the key to everybody's success and bringing those people in and all that stuff. And that often works, but sometimes it's not enough and that's a real challenge for sure. Yeah, and I think, yeah, they just group people and actually monthly.com, they've got a bunch of different courses and I think the Casey Neistat one is on now and I signed up to it just to sort of see behind the hood of what that cohort looked like. So there's no live elements there, but they group you with like a group of 20 others. And I think it's what you're saying, it's sort of just, you're giving the impression that straight away, you have a connection with these other people, you have a sort of almost a duty to get involved so they don't feel let down and you're helping each other out. So that accountability and connection is happening, it's just not that forced live, we're here now on a Tuesday at 9 a.m. to like putting you into breakout rooms. So I do wonder how, does that live Zoom breakout bit need to be happening or is it actually just, if you connect people together in a group, like through Discord and Slack and all of that stuff then? You know, like, and I think that there's, you know, like there's, they're both are valid and there's, you know, like, if you can do that and you can provide and you help some people and people sign up and that works, that's great. I am curious, like, what's something I'm very curious about, do you have like a formal instructional design philosophy or strategy or prior like influence in that space? I don't actually, like I've read that question and thought I should come up with a good answer for this for just in general life, I should have one, like I feel like I should have looked into that, but I just, I haven't at all, I just, I've done whatever I thought I would have wanted to see someone else do and that's how like MakerBag came together and building it and I just, again, copied from other people, I think I saw, it was a guy's name, Chris from Go Rails, was like one of the sites I saw and I said, well, oh, someone could live stream, that like can screen record their stuff and just talk over it and put that up and behind a paywall, that's a business, he's making like 15 grand a month at that time, so that's how I started saying, I'll just do the same, I'll do a short video tutorial like that and then you just see those patterns out like on other sites but I haven't really sat down and thought of that myself. And you're not alone and when we started AKEhead up through just even a few years ago, that was kind of our approach and for me, if you want a very pleasant and kind of thorough and world-class introduction to that space, Kathy Sierra's badass is absolutely, her book, Badass Making Users Awesome, is the best like instructional design primer that exists, it is fantastic and really a great way to kind of open up into that. Yeah, so I'll look up that because I think, I wonder if, like to me, it's always been a feeling of, this is how I learned, so this is how I think we should teach it to be taught, like this is how it should be taught and then it's just been through, yeah, whatever I thought people do differently, people always do differently, people always don't read and people always don't, people skip things and it's just things like that that sort of throw you off a bit and think, oh, so we actually changed that thing because we thought this, but people don't work like that or think like that and just assume this, so something changes that way, but I'll read that book definitely. Yeah, another recent favorite is Rob Fitzpatrick's, he has, it's called the Workshop Survival Guide and How to Write Useful Books and Rob's done this amazing job of really capturing a lot of this kind of theory and practical ways too, that it's fun when you've been doing this for a long time and then you can read something that's like, wow, like startlingly accurate and I wish I had this 10 years ago, kind of smack in the face and that's what he's done. So you're sitting around and you decided to build your own platform instead of just using something off the shelf because there's platforms like Teachable and Podia and these sorts of things and you went for it and built your own platform and what was kind of the trigger to DIY and I'm assuming you're kind of using your no-code tools and stuff too in the process to do that, but like what made you decide to build a platform instead of grabbing something off the rack? I mean, I think part of it initially was, it's a challenge for me to build, I'd like to, I'm teaching people how to build stuff with no-code, I can't just use something off the shelf, I've got to show that the thing that they're using to learn no-code is the most impressive thing they've seen with no-code, like I needed to sort of talk my own game and I don't know if I just, when I had the skills to build what I feel like was anything at the time, like I know no-code, I can do anything, I feel like I can build this platform myself. You always automatically think, oh, I want to do this thing, I'll build that, I can just build it, I'll just build that whole thing, exactly how I want to do it and it'll be the exact things I want and then when you try and use something else that is the tool that has been built for that thing, you're like, oh, I just wish that was slightly different because I would have done it like this and I'm trying, I've been trying to like stop saying I'll just build it and then actually building it, like I've tried to stop myself doing that because there are all these tools out there that do the right jobs for a lot of these things and a lot of them need to be like 80% of what you would have thought anyway but often it was things that I just wanted a bit more control over exactly how it would look, exactly where certain things would go and yeah, some of it was just testing myself but yeah, there's tons of, I mean, we use Disco now for our cohorts. We did our first cohort with just Airtable, Slack, Notion and that's how we did it. We just had the content in a Notion doc and that was like set up that way. So, I mean, there's so many different ways to do it too but yeah, we use Disco for that, for the cohort piece now.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Yeah, I was going to ask, I was wondering if you're starting today and you're going to build, you're going to launch a course or launch a learning platform of your own design to teach your expertise, how would you approach it today that might be different from how you approached it when you first started thinking about MakerPen? Well, I found out yesterday, I sent a video to my team yesterday, that Google has something called Google Classroom, which lets people sign up, take your course, assignments, submit them, you can mark them, there's comments on there, you can have any type of media in there, YouTube videos, text, all of that stuff, all basically free and it all looks quite clean and nice and it's an easy sign-in experience because it's not another thing someone has to sign into necessarily, a lot of people will be able to sign in easily to that. I couldn't believe that I just, being someone who has a course platform, I just had no idea that that existed and that would have, to me, if I was doing that tomorrow, I'd probably just set something up in that, have a landing page in Webflow, when you've paid, you get an email that links you to that Google Classroom and that's how I do it. My child's Montessori school actually uses that and I never, before you just mentioned it, thought about using it for anything outside of my child's Montessori school communications that we have to use as parents. That's pretty wild, actually. I'm going to check that out for sure, that's great. The other thing, I love Notion and we've been using Notion as a prototype platform, so when we're beta testing courses and doing that sort of thing, we'll just put it in Notion and have the content there because people can leave comments and do stuff and it's great, but that's definitely an interesting option and I assume, I don't know, that's probably something that evolved out of the whole global situation too, that they've put resources into that and kind of bringing some of that back into the Google sphere. Yeah, they must have. We do the same with our content before it's ready, it's all in Notion. Everything's like a toggled lesson and you just go through it that way. It's very easy to just do that and get feedback and tweak stuff, so that's how we plan it. I've got very generous guest policies too. Cost is an issue and in a lot of these platforms, you start talking about Airtable and stuff and it gets extremely expensive if you're bringing a lot of people into it and Notion has one of the most generous and just kind of useful guest approaches that I've experienced. I wonder at some point if they'll change that. Yeah, I think it was less so like this previously and then they've made it more open. I guess, because they know people are going to sign up. What's a challenge that stands out over the years so far running a learning platform? I don't know if it's a very good business. I don't know if running a learning platform is a very good business. To me, it feels like you either have to go the route of something like Udemy, where you have an open thing. People can put their own courses up, you take a cut, you get loads of venture money to build this huge platform and it's very transactional. You're just trying to get people in and you're taking cuts from other people. $9.99 this week. Yeah, exactly. It feels like there's quite a few of those types of platforms. There's the other side, which is more, I guess, where we are, which is Code Academy, Egghead. Those types of platforms are more, this is a single site, you sign up, you learn here. Seems like acquisition is often a path in that realm. Yeah. It happens. Yeah. Lots of these get swallowed up and bought. We were bought by Zapier, but we're allowed to do our own thing and run independently because it's not. I was happy to see not a lot of changes, actually, after your acquisition. Yeah. We're not a Zapier training tool and they don't want us to be a Zapier training tool. That's not the point of what it is and why we joined forces. But to me, I just felt like learning is a very difficult thing to monetize because if I'm ... You want subscription revenue because you want predictable revenue, but I never wanted to do subscriptions because I just didn't want the headache of thinking, who's going to churn? Why are they going to churn? How can I stop them churning? Because I felt like it was almost wasted energy thinking and trying to stop that. I've never tried because I agree with you and we're a subscription service and I've never focused on churn. It's like- Yeah. I feel like it would just eat you up and think, I'm spending so much time trying to stop someone from churning this year and they might do it next year and I've got them and you're thinking all that stuff. So to me, I was like, it's odd. And also, if I sign up to learn something and it'll charge me again next month, if life gets in the way, my job, kids, whatever it is, and I haven't done something, am I going to pay for it next month? No. I'm just going to cancel it straight away and think, right, I'll just do that. I'll pick that up again when I've got time and it'll just be the same cycle might happen. I might sign up three times. So that feels like an odd thing to me because we never did monthly subscriptions. We did a lifetime plan, which was me thinking, I don't think people would stick around for two years or more initially. So I'm going to charge them over what two years will cost. So then we get that revenue up front. It's good for cashflow when I'm bootstrapping. And that's sort of how we started. We just started with a lifetime and started increasing that up to like $600. And we then introduced a yearly subscription as well because people were asking for it. And then that was like $200 and it's one of those things that I just find, again, if I haven't used something in that one year or I can't remember hanging around in MakerPad building stuff with no code for a considerable amount of time that year, I'm going to renew my Netflix and everything else first. And then I'm not sure, maybe I will do MakerPad. I've learned my no code stuff now and maybe I don't need it. So we're always battling with that, or I certainly was. And I think we almost want people to graduate and say, yeah, you know how to use no code now. Well, they met their goals or whatever that they started out with. They wanted to build a business or they wanted to do something in their life that was different. And they've achieved that. And completing new courses doesn't necessarily add to that original goal that they set out to achieve to begin with. Yeah. And those people, if we then start building tutorials for that sort of person who have graduated, they don't have to build something like MakerPad. They want to deal with webhooks, APIs, and all of this really complex niche stuff for advanced no coders, which is the nichest of the niche things. But yeah, you're just serving a small amount of people, whereas what I did early on was just I built tutorials as I was learning. My tutorials were getting more advanced as I was getting more advanced in my teaching. And then I was like, wait a second, I forgot everyone who never heard of no code before. So we're trying to make sure that we are now getting the biggest piece in that front weight, that piece, and just have enough that people who can build stuff just want to stick around to build stuff and talk about, oh, that's impressive. I like figure this thing out rather than I'm here to learn the next thing. What's next? Yeah. And I mean, like with Egghead, our kind of business model is predicated on the fact that there's a constant churn in the space and web development is ever evolving. And there's always something new to learn to stay ahead of where you're at. And it works. And we've avoided being gobbled up over the years and kind of intentionally on my part, I've chased away potential investors for years and years just as a stubborn refusal and working on the problem myself. I want to go back because it is a good business, but it is not like a guaranteed business, right? Like you can sit down and you can build an education company and succeed, or you can launch a course and succeed. You don't have to build an entire company or platform, right? Like you can just like teach what you know and put it out there on the internet and have some measure of success. It's just how you measure that. And whether it's revenue or helping as many people as possible, like there's all sorts of ways to kind of slice up the idea of success. One thing I wanted to, I thought was interesting, you're talking about subscriptions and going back and like, how do you price things? Cause that's always a very, you know, like how much do I charge per month? How much do I charge for this? And like over the years, over, you know, almost a full decade of doing this and having a subscription business, like at this point we know like the customer lifetime value, right? Like, and you take the customer lifetime value and multiply that by, you know, 50%, like add 50% on top of that. And instead of a subscription, why not just a subscription? And instead of a subscription, why not just charge a flat fee, right? Like you end up like, just give them the lifetime cause then they can just access it whenever. I mean, that really struck me. I saw that somebody said, well, if you know the customer lifetime value, why not just charge that up front instead of, you know, like dealing with the recurring billing and all that. And I thought that was a really interesting way to think about pricing versus, I don't know, people expect it to like, people expect subscriptions or expect a certain thing. And you know, like if you're not giving that and they want it, then like, sure, here, here you go and sign up. And it is, but pricing is very difficult. Like, what is this work worth? And what is it, what kind of value is it bringing to them? And like, in your case, if somebody succeeds at MakerPad, right? Like if they succeed in doing what they set out to do, the like return on their initial investment, whatever hundreds of dollars that is, is, is just bonkers. Like, I think I, I credit Amy Hoy's 30 by 500 for a lot of our kind of way we established our business early. And, and I remember having like a family meeting about the $1,200 that course costed. And we just like this year broke the $30 million in revenue mark for a $1,200 course that kind of like was the spark that ignited the entire thing. And to me, it's like, that's amazing, but it's like, that's also, you know, if you look at the bell curve, it's definitely on the outlier side of it. Most people just kind of drop out at the, like, never really doing anything side of it. So always a fun balance. Yeah. I mean, yeah. The price and stuff is crazy. And that's, that's just how I thought about it. I was like, well, would I want to have to like sign up for something for hundreds of dollars a year? I was like, oh, I just pay once and that'd be awesome. I think I've seen a few like makers do it. I think Peter Levels with Nomad List tried it. And yeah, I just, I thought, well, I think people would stick around for like, they'll maybe do two years. But I think after that, it'll be a struggle to keep them here for the reasons I outlined. I think that, yeah. So we said, okay, well do two years plus a hundred dollars, have that as a lifetime. If people are happy to pay that, I've not forced them to, I've given them the yearly option. And it was just overwhelmingly people would do lifetime. They would just, it was like 60, 70% would do lifetime. And often it's the people who are doing yearly sign up, get the video they wanted, and then they're off. That's all they wanted anyway. So yeah. I tell you what I will not do again is a subscription site with a royalty aspect. That adds a whole financial twist to the entire thing with an ever-growing roster of content and folks that you pay it out. That's been what you end up having is that you end up building an accounting platform versus the stuff you actually want to look at. And when I had that realization that I had built an accounting platform, I was really, I never set out to do that. Never in my life would I set out to build an accounting platform. They exist and bless them for their service. But yeah, it's an interesting realization when you wake up one morning and realize what you've built. Yeah. I bet you were thrilled. Don't want to say I'm happy to hear you say that, but I am happy to hear you say that because so many times I looked at the how to produce on Egghead site, just copied and pasted all of your stuff, put it into Notion and thought, right, we're going to have a platform similar. We'll pay out people. That's how we can get content in. This is how we're going to do it. And I was always, always trying to figure out a way that that could work. And I was like, it just feels too messy and it feels too difficult. And I just, especially, I think probably the blessing of the no code stack then was, well, you're really going to have to stick all these things together and it's going to probably break quite a lot. And you're going to have to maintain this. And I was too lazy to think I'm happy to do that. And we just never, never went down the path of we'll do royalties. So now you saying that I'm like, okay, good. That was a good, either forced like obstacle that I took. So yeah. Yeah. And it's like, there's a, there's a whole, there's this thing called the ethical pool, like royalty pools are flawed just by nature and you can search ethical pool and it's mostly related to music and like Spotify streaming. And as the pool grows, it dilutes and like, it's a whole, it's like a math mess at the end of the day and, you know, like getting into math messes. And we just like took Spotify's algorithm is how we originally did the, the, the Royal and it's still how it is today. And it's been versus the other approach that we take where it's like, we, we have a course product and it's a partnership with a single person. So, and, and the one-off sale and using that one-off sale price instead of a subscription where with a subscription, you, you know, like it's every month you're having to pay a bunch of people based on a percentage versus like one-off sales where it's like, okay, we sold the X dollars a month. You get your cut, we get our cut. Thanks for doing business has been great. And it's a lot less complicated than the, the, like creating a, a marketplace royalty driven marketplace, which has been an interesting challenge and I'm still all for it and we're going to continue. But as we kind of spin up other, other products and using the same methodology, that's one thing that we've, we've dropped to the wayside because it's, it's really quite complex. And, you know, is there a no code accounting platform? I don't think so. Like you're going to be full code at that point. And so, yeah, exactly. It just sounds like a, sounds like a headache. That's a, this is my last question. And I want to know, like, at what point do you hit the limits of no code? Have you hit those limits? And when do you have to, you know, break it out and, and start like building custom or, or is it something you think you can get away with perpetually? I mean, you can get away with it for a long, a long time, I think. And I think it's a lot longer than people think. I mean, we're three years, yeah, three years old. Oh, you know, that's not a long, that's not a long life cycle for a business. Yeah, I guess. And that like tens of thousands of users, like hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue, nothing's ever, like the site's never gone down for any reason other than like a cloud flare issue or whatever. Things, things break, but like they do on every side, there's bugs here, there and everywhere. But we did have a point where, so we use Webflow and we use SCMS for all of our tutorial content. And things are slow on our site because we just have so much content and it's just, yeah, it's slow. But as our like maturity as a company, the amount of content and stuff was increasing over time. So Webflow is getting better over time too. And they're trying to, they want you to be able to do everything without code because that's, there's no better, like there's no better promo for their business to say that this whole thing's built on Webflow. So they're always working on new things and they got a membership beta out now and all of that stuff to help like sort of relieve some of the other tools added to the stack. But we, yeah, because of the, because we had the CMS, we had all of our users in that CMS because I was desperate and adamant to have everyone have a public facing profile so you could show what tools you've used and what tutorials you've completed and all of that stuff. They just wanted that really, really badly. And the only way we could figure it out was to have the Webflow CMS. And then we got to the 10,000 CMS limit. Then we had to think, right, well, what are we going to do? Because just, we can't do this. I hired a developer and we worked on sort of linking the Webflow site with Firebase. So then there was like one profile page and it was like dynamically being rendered by data on Firebase. So we tried that for a bit as well. And then it was just like, well, it turned out no one was really using the feature anyway. It was just something I was adamant to build. I wanted that thing. It felt like one of the things that had to be in a platform like ours. So we got rid of that and then we're back to all no code at the moment and still haven't ever figured out the profile piece of where we would do that. So when Webflow said the membership stuff, that was exciting. But yeah, we'll see how that goes. But yeah, you can build a lot of things with no code. I think it's, I'm not going to pretend that you can do everything because I don't want a load of developers that's coming after me. But you can certainly do, you can run a successful business. You can run like millions of dollars through it. There's like, there's so much you can do other than like just MVP website up and people can give you their email. It's like, it's so much more than that. So I don't want, I don't like when people just sort of brush it off as that. But yeah, there's, we're always going to need developers. We need the developers to build the tools that we're using. Yeah. I mean, the no code itself is going to need an army of developers behind the scenes doing that for sure. I think like in particular, if you're talking about building course platforms or delivering like an educational content, or if you're an expert and you want to like share your knowledge and charge people an entry fee, I think like the no code stack has so like that level of application development is very prime for the space and something like even now, as I'm thinking about starting up another, like my own course and thinking about what platform and I have, you know, this, this bespoke platform I built, I'm intentionally not using my platform and tools that I've had at my disposal and thinking about it like, okay, I want to do this. Like, how would I do this if I didn't have all that at my disposal? And that's kind of where this conversation actually stemmed from is like, I want to like think about building and teaching, you know, from the perspective of, I don't have a bunch of, you know, like a full stack that I've, I've just, I've, I've sunk millions of dollars into building a stack. And, and I love it. And it's very effective, but like, what would I do if I didn't have that today? And, and, and, you know, like in 2022. So that's, that's been an approach I've been thinking about too. And it's, it's really cool to see what you built and what other people are building and can build without getting into, you know, like opening up a code editor and the terminal and firing up Postgres databases and doing all that stuff. It's really fascinating to me and awesome, actually. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. Yeah. And I mean, I think of that every probably three months, much to the delight of my team. It's, if we were going to start this all from scratch, if we, if we deleted everything, what would we do? Are we teaching things in the right way? Should we do this? Should we do that? So we are actually making some changes soon because I've even seen things like Free Code Camp is just such a simple, I can see their CMS structure would be so simple because everything's class is the same type of content. They've got their like structured curriculum and it's just even things like student directory just takes you to LinkedIn. Like you don't have to build your own. I said this earlier, but you don't have to build the thing. Not everything has to be built from scratch and has to have all of your touches on it. I'd say probably build from scratch and probably, you know, like, like do what you want. I'm not telling anybody how to live their lives, but like you can make your life a little easier and maybe like value to the people you're trying to help in the first place quicker and like prove out your ideas and reach what you have set out in terms of success in a way that, I don't know, isn't as painful or expensive or time-consuming, you know, kind of get on with your life. Yeah, but I think again, it's one of those procrastination things that people use to say, no, this, this platform is different. No, this, the course I'm trying to do is actually very different to what other like Teachable and all these others can, can give me and it won't be the same unless it can be this way and really know your idea is not that unique. Just get on with it and use the tools on there. That's yeah. I am a snowflake, Ben. I really appreciate it. I thank you. Thank you for building MakerPad and kind of enabling this because I think it's a value add to the world and I hope more people like get in there and explore and build and create using these tools because it's, it really does open up a lot of opportunity. I really appreciate it. Thanks very much. Yeah. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey Brennan. Hey. What's up Joel? Pretty stoked to talk to you today. We've worked together. I'm like an aficionado of your courses in particular and I send a lot of people to them because they've radically changed how I think and operate and do business and I think that's fantastic because I don't know that there's a lot of courses out there that you can say that about. But before we dig into all that, I want to ask you how you personally approach complex subject or something that you want to learn. I'm super novice and when I've been going about learning Vue, my approach with that which is pretty for me across the board is just to do the basic bare minimum learning through whether it be videos on YouTube or written blog posts or whatever else but also to jump in head first and break stuff. So I'm very much like I have friends who will do a crap ton of academic learning up front before they even dive in head first whether it be new technology or new subject or something like that. But I'm very much personally very driven by cause and effect. So can I learn just bare minimum, try something out like a hello world, see it in action, see how it works and then iterate on that with more educational material and then apply and more and apply and so on and so forth. So I don't know if that answers your question, but I'm very much a let's break things quickly kind of guy. I've seen you've been recently in the wood shop too, which I think is a similar kind of experience, right? You just go out there and start sawing and measuring and cutting and building. Yeah. And with the stuff coming out of it, it's shit. Like I'm doing a playhouse in the backyard right now. And yeah, I mean, I've learned the hard way the importance of what all these YouTube videos I saw and the importance of squaring is with if it's not square then you're just going to have like weird off cuts of your decking boards and stuff like that. So yeah, I mean I, that's how I thrive. I think I do better like screwing up a lot and then learning that way versus somebody telling me, don't be aware of this, don't do this otherwise, whatever. Like finding the pitfalls yourself instead of having them all pointed out to you in a tidy roadmap. And I'm just impatient. I mean, I just like to, I couldn't imagine like sitting through too much training on woodworking before I actually got out there with a saw and a chisel and did stuff. Yeah. So, I mean, in that respect, you probably wouldn't watch one of your own courses. You would just do the work and then yeah, I mean, yeah, because I would probably like if I were, if I came across my own stuff, to be honest, I would probably pass on it for a bit in favor of just going in and trying weird shit until something works. But that being said, I have more recently, I did invest in a proper to go back to the woodworking theme and a proper comprehensive course. Now that I've got that itch of like discovery out of me, I'm now willing to dive deeper into learning from people who have obviously been doing this for a long time. So I would say like, at first I like to jump in head first and cut myself a few times, but then I'll go through the proper stuff. Once I think, once I see that, okay, I do enjoy this, I do want to continue down this path. Then and only then will I usually then jump into something with a bit more rigor, if that makes sense. Yeah. Woodworking is tough because you end up with all the tools too. Like I have, I own a table saw. I don't use a table saw, but I have a table saw. And that was like my own adventure into woodworking. I'm like, oh, I need a table saw. I took a class and we used one and I was like, oh, I definitely need that. Then you end up with a table saw and then what are you going to do with that? The digital stuff where it's a lot easier to less takes up a lot less space in the garage. But tools are fun. So. Well, and every time I hear the table saw spin up because somebody needs a table saw in my house, I get so excited. I'm like, oh yeah, the table saw is getting used. It's so fast and efficient. We can cut wood. Nobody's business. You've got to have the tools to do the thing, but it's always that trap of tools, right? Like you can't buy cameras and become a better photographer. You have to take pictures to become a better photographer. And it's the same is true for like web development or building things with wood or whatever. To actually do the thing is how you become good at it. And that is, to be honest, to go back to that earlier, that first question you posed to me, one problem I definitely do have is I try to get to mastery ASAP, I think. So I went out and bought probably every imaginable woodworking tool that I'd need ever upfront. And then just started playing with them all and doing stuff with them rather than what I should have done, which is only acquire new tooling when you have something, a project on hand that needs the tool. But I don't like to, I don't like to be at that amateur's phase or stage too long. I like to, I mean, you can see what the pros use. So why not just jump right to it? Yeah, exactly. I'm the same way. We won't talk about synthesizers. So when you, if you're evaluating a course or creating your own course, what goes into it? What makes a really good course in your opinion? I mean, I think for me, I've, I think I've produced meh courses, but also really good ones. And I find that the really good ones tend to be things that I'm really confident at and teaching. So case in point with the, probably the one that I've done that, that has had the most kind of effect in terms of the people going through it, writing to me saying, this has been monumental for me. That'd probably be like mastering ConvertKit at this point. And where that came from was really having done a V1 of that course titled Mastering Drip before I ditched Drip. And then before that was doing a ton of individualized consulting work and own and personal experimentation. But I think most importantly, consulting work where I was actually hired by a few companies to come in and do some of that work, but also more importantly, relay it onto their marketing team to show them like what's going on and why is this useful and how do you do it and so on. So that act of needing to communicate what I wanted to, what I knew internally to someone, somebody else again and again, made it so when I went into the cave and hit record, I think I was much better equipped to do that because otherwise I think the products that have done worse for me in terms of like success rates have been the ones where I might know some subject fairly well, but my ability to translate what I know to help somebody with who wants that knowledge, ability to transfer that knowledge is pretty subpar. So for me, I found that the things that I've done best with have been things that I've iterated on with previous versions of that course or done, whether it be live group workshops or individual consulting and just done it again and again. Like I think you, if you remember my consultancy masterclass from like nine years ago now or something. Yeah. I did. It changed my life. Yeah. And I did like that. I did that 15 times, I think. It was a two day, all day workshop, do that 15 times. And I mean, frankly, the 15th class got the best version of the class, right? You keep doing it better and better each time because you get to learn what am I saying? What am I teaching that is falling on deaf ears? What is being challenged? Where are people still confused at the end of it? And then you can just use that to better teach it in the future. So I think mistake wise, whenever I've gone first into recording, say a video course without doing that live discussion based component multiple times, those courses, those products always tend to not be nearly as effective. And I end up probably redoing them after learning that. Yeah. And I think it's interesting because to me, consulting is the format of teaching, right? Like you're doing and you're implementing, but it's a format. And then you go to instructor led workshops and maybe cohort based courses. And finally you get to like a book and a self-paced course and that sort of thing. But it's not drawn from, you're not doing research on the internet and then creating a course really. You are like, you have to iterate. And between those, between consulting and workshops and self-paced courses, it feels like there's trade-offs. And what's the trade-off that you're getting between a live workshop and like a self-paced course? Well, you can't talk back to a self-paced course, right? I mean, maybe you can through like a community group or something. But it's not as, the thing I keep thinking about that I was actually thinking about, I did a live workshop two weekends ago and I mentioned this, so I don't know if you remember that thing Patrick McKenzie said once where a lot of his consulting gigs were basically dramatic readings of blog posts he's written already. And that's so true, I think with context, right? Yeah, exactly. Applied, his 10,000 word blog post applied specifically to this company's situation where if the recommendations, the prescriptions are all still the same, but examples might be different and the language might differ and so on and so forth. And I think that's something that, I used to write that off as how important really is that? Why not just go straight to like, why pay for the dramatic recital of Patrick's blog posts when you could just read the blog post? But I do think now, especially since I've done many of these workshops, that it is more important than I initially thought to feel as you're receiving the information that the examples resonate with you and that the references are meaningful to you and that the language being used applies to. It's that whole, that worldview thing that I know Amy talks a lot about. I never really internalized, I guess, how important it was for that. And I think that's frankly, for me, one of the biggest benefits, whether it be hiring a consultant or doing a live discussion-based workshop is the ability to have that student context be incorporated into the teaching itself. So when you're teaching that and you're dealing with students and you're hearing their context or you're dealing with consulting clients and you're enmeshed in their context as well, at some point you probably get to the tipping point where you've heard enough and can see the similarities or have divided it down into, it's these four things generally. And are you learning the teachable moments as well and through this experience, figuring it out as you develop, do you start thinking self-paced course is eventually going to come from this? Or is it more like an experimentation and evolution through the process? I think lately I've been thinking that self-paced course. So the workshop I did two weekends ago, when I sold it, I basically made it very clear that I do want to turn this into a self-paced course eventually, but I want to have the students in the first few iterations of it be the guinea pigs that I need to figure out what to teach in that self-paced course. And I also actually made it a bit of a two for one saying when it does become a self-paced course, you'll get it free. So not only do you get the course eventually, but you're going to help me by getting something more valuable than you will out of a self-paced course, because you're going to get your specific needs addressed and so on, rather than needing to watch some sort of monologue that is very intentionally designed to apply to probably a large swath of people, which is the underlying requirement I think of a prerecorded course where it is a monologue. It's me to them, me to the, whoever happens to be watching this. And that necessitates me generally, unless it's super niched to be intentionally broad about certain things and not dig into specifics or anything like that. Whereas with a live workshop, I can have somebody pipe up and say, Hey, here's my unique situation. How does what you're saying apply to this? And that's why I think as a student, live workshops are a lot more valuable than prerecorded. Yeah. I'm always on the fence because I love live workshops, but then I feel like it fades where and Master and Convert Kit is interesting to me as a, just an example, because I've used it so much and I've gone through, I was a consultancy client of yours. And I remember drip.js from, I think it's still in my code base and I've seen the evolution of it. And it's interesting because I returned to it and I'm like, I go back and I go back in different phases. Like I come back to the material because I'm like, it's always like you have to build and I'm able to return to it where some of the workshops I've been to, it feels like I go and I do it. And then maybe I have some notes or my little project that I did, but I'm left in kind of a lurch. So it's always, there's, that's one of the trade-offs that I think, Grant, like I can revisit this and get my own pace, like spiral back through this content or learning stuff, re-approach exercises, that sort of thing that I can't do in a live scenario. So it's really, I mean, there's benefits to both formats in my opinion. Well, I think to extend on that, the one thing I tried to do with this, the latest workshop I did, I developed it right after reading Rob Fitzpatrick's book on, yeah, on live workshops. And the thing that I think I made the mistake of early on was treating a live workshop as a live video course, effectively, right? Where it's just me doing my monologue. Because he's got that flow, I suggest. So what I did was I did the, like a 10 minute, very short introductory lesson, really just to ground us all on, so we're on the same page and speaking the same language and then got into discussion and then got into a, what I call the action part where it was more of, I want to make sure by the end of the workshop, you're walking away with a Google doc of all these bullet points that are going to get you going. And then what I'm doing now is I'm following up over the span of about two months with additional material and additional context that relates to that. So like the idea is, what can you get from a live event like that, that you can't get from a prerecorded video course. With that, I can, as the host, the facilitator, I can encourage you and make sure that by the end of it, you walk away with this Google doc of like action items, of to-do tasks. But you need to know how to execute on the to-do. So my thinking is what I'm doing now is I'm sending out like, it's simple, it's a little loom videos. Okay. So in the first learning module, we talk about X, Y, and Z. You have in your task list for that module stuff, and here's some videos on how to implement and execute on the high level things that you outlined in that doc. So I didn't show them, we've sticked, it was like with roadmapping where we stuck to high level outcome-based stuff during the workshop, didn't get into any of the technical weeds. But now what I'm doing is I'm drip out, dripping out material that is helping them technically execute on the big picture directional stuff that we focused on during the live event. Because I think where it'd be no sense in me getting on like a live Zoom call and sharing my screen and like walking through arcane technical convert kit stuff. Doesn't make sense. It's better off as a video. But for the discussion, like probing kind of stuff, I find a live event so much better for that. So I wanted to really make it so if this is going to be a live event, let's actually make it, let's leverage the uniqueness that we get from something live, which meant ignoring entirely technical execution, all that kind of stuff. So I've done a lot of workshops in my life and Rob Fitzpatrick's, the workshop survival guide is the name of the book that you mentioned has, was like, it's one of the most succinct and interesting. And his book that follows that is, is write useful books. And I'm like, and then he has the mom test. And as a sequence, the mom test workshop, survival guide and write useful books is like the best primer of practical implementation of like, I'm an expert. I'm going to, you know, like see people's problems. I'm going to teach them live and then I'm going to codify it. And he stops at useful books and I'm like, I read, I don't know if you've read the right useful books. I have. Yeah. To me, it's, you could say great courses and just replace the title. And really, if you think about the value proposition of books versus courses to me, like he's written just absolutely like the basic, get in and understand and start doing this. And it's like on our recommended list, if I was making a box set, that's, and then Amy Hoy's just fucking ship is in there as well. Yep. Just as like, here's the, the, the set and you can go and you can teach, but his workshop survival guide is, is great in that it's, you know, not just lecture, it's multimodal and you're switching back and forth between, you know, showing, doing and telling. And I really enjoyed it. And I think that's the thing, like you can't, you can't do that with something prerecorded. You can't get that depth of multimodal anything. And I think that's why I really wanted to say when I do this workshop that I really want to use really frankly, selfishly to pioneer the eventual video course, because I don't like having things on my calendar that I need to go to. So I'd much rather replace it with something that people could just buy on their own. I, yeah, I wanted to just, I wanted to make sure that I do this right. It'll be truly discussion-based and truly a true dialogue where I'm learning just as much as they're learning. And then, so we, the host and the attendee gets equal value out of the event, and then I can then use what I learn to then create the right video course, not just a video course. So I think that's a big thing that I think I've been trying to think about a lot lately, which is the distinction between successfully making a video course or something with like X many lessons and blah, blah, blah, versus the right video course, where it actually succeeds in the, in the fullest sense of the word at solving the problem that led somebody to buy it. Yeah. At the end of the day, like if the course isn't making that difference in the learner's lives, right? That's the success is that it's actually effective. And then you get the financial success and there's other outcomes that are important to you. But like at the end of the day, the course itself has to be effective and successful for the people that are taking it for it. And let's face it, if it's more successful, there'll be more word of mouth referrals. And it's just, it's good for, it's good for everyone when that happens. So yeah, people are succeeding. They talk about it. Right. And I'm, I'm not waving a flag for mastering convert kit, not because of the affiliate program, which I appreciate, but I'm waving the flag because it's really been effective for me. And I think people should watch it because they learn a lot. And, and I'm going to go out and do that. And the more successful you are with a book or a course, then the more you're likely to share it. And that's really the best, I think at the end of the day, that's, that's the best marketing you can get is people having success with your product. Do, so there's a lot of off the shelf kind of course platforms out there. And I was throwing the air quotes around my, my, and, and I don't want to drag them too hard, but do they encourage successful courses from the learner's perspective? I guess what my real question is like, why? Cause you've built your own course platform now over the last year and a half or so you've actually left kind of these generic course platforms and built your own. And why would you do that? And like, why wouldn't you just use something off the shelf? Let me answer that first question that you had about to the, to the hosted platforms help deliver actual good courses. I think they, they attempt to in their content marketing. I think you go to blog or podiums blog. I'm sure there are articles on like how to develop great courses and stuff like that. Yeah. But I do think that with the, with, I mean, you, you and I are both rails people. So I don't know if this will make sense to everyone else, but it does seem like most courseware platforms tend to really just go down the scaffolding route for everything of like, I scaffold out a lesson and I can create lessons. I can update lessons. I can retrieve and delete them. And what I'm getting at is they're very much like placeholdery. Like you got a lesson as a title. Lesson might have a video attached. Lesson might have this, you click save, you reorder it, you file them neatly under modules and so on and so forth. And I mean, technically, yeah. If you want to look at like a features page that that ticks the box of what a courseware platform is expected to do. But I do think though that at the end of the day, these are simply tools and tools can be used correctly or incorrectly. And it's, I would question like what job does ConvertKit have in helping people send really good emails. And I think that's difficult as a software company to be really good at educating and really good at delivering good tools too. It behooves them to try, but that's not really what they're there for. I think they tend to try through like lead generating blog posts, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. Like general content marketing, right? It's not built in and integrated into the product itself. It's just like a blog post about five things that you should do in your course or something. I think it's unfortunate because I think like you, it'd be interesting to see how can the platform itself be less crud-like or less scaffold and more something that's more, I can't imagine what the UX would be like, but something like let's define first what we want the outcome to be for your students and then helping you work backward and lay out the right lessons and lay out the right material and so on. So I don't know. I don't know if any platform has done that or has attempted to do anything like that outside of like basic first-time onboarding or blog posts or whatever else. Where you get an email sequence or they're like, go read this blog post. This is like, you should read this or study this, but the platform doesn't really drive It's not built into the platform and into how it's designed. It would probably annoy people, honestly, and be like less mass market. If you're like, oh, you're going to have to do this stuff before you can make your course. People are gonna be like, I recorded all these videos already. So can I just post them please? Yeah, exactly. But to answer your question about why I'm not just using a hosted platform, I built my own and the reason I built my own is there's the user experience angle and there's also the, I want to make money angle for reasons why I did it. I'll start with the money one. I've always subscribed, I think, to the multi-tiered way of thinking about products. The Delkian approach. The Delkian approach. What was it? 1x, 2.2x, 5x or something insane. But yeah, if you remember back, like all of us 10 years ago, we were doing the like ebook videos, full package, three pricing thing. I'm still doing that. But the issue I've always had is that whole saying it's easier to sell more to existing customers and why? Like why? I haven't seen any courseware platform that makes it easy to say like, here, add your basic content and then tease the premium content, but gray it out if they don't own that package. And then if they click it, maybe have a big like one click upgrade button thing or something. I wanted that kind of functionality and I just couldn't see how to do that with any of the platforms I looked at. And I wanted to be able to do things like if somebody shares a public lesson, maybe do something like, I did this with W Freelancing where they were mostly text courses, but I would have the first 200 words visible and then I'd have a little grading overlay and it would fade out with them, have a upsell or buy now join the course, unlock content called action. So I wanted stuff like that. I wanted to be able to do things like that. I wanted to integrate things like, let's say I eventually want to attach like a product of one-off transactional product to a lesson. I'm supposed to say it's a lesson on something about liquid. And I come up with a something that's outside of the course, maybe like the temple pack I did. And I want to promote that somehow. I wanted to eventually be able to do that nicely. And I just, it seemed like the way that all these courseware platforms were set up is you'd have a storefront and then you'd buy a course and then you'd have like your dashboard of courses you have access to, but there wasn't any like intercourse relating stuff, which is what I wanted. So I, even though I I'm not fully there yet, I'm starting to work toward that with the create and sell stuff I'm doing now. I wanted to be able to eventually be there. So that was one of, that's probably the selfish money-making reason I rolled my own. From the UX perspective though, I always thought it was weird. I won't name names, but like certain platforms would, would do things like make it so you can't easily have resources attached to lessons. And my lessons are usually very long video lessons. And I wanted to have like a associated Google.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"block like that you could then duplicate and mess with or this or that. And it was always awkward to do that both from like me as the, you know, course creator going and actually setting it up, but also as the student, like seeing that. And I wanted to do little things. If I have a 45 minute long video, which I know like a lot of people, my, the biggest complaint people have is that my videos aren't two to three minutes or something. Um, I agree. Cause I actually, I can't, I, I, I hate going through a video course that is in these small little chunks, especially if I'm casting it to my TV, because then it just throws off Chromecast and it just never works. So mine are long. Many of my lessons are long, but I wanted to be able to leverage, I'm using whiskey as the video host and I want it to leverage their chapters. So I just built onto my coursework, you know, platform recently, the ability to have a chapter list within a lesson. So you can just click and it would jump directly to it and stuff along with highlighting transcript stuff. So I had the transcript for every lesson now, and I want it to be able to add this subtitles, but also give you a nice transcript that you could either read on the page or download is I, it's just, I couldn't find a platform that ticked all the boxes, both from the sales perspective. Um, and what I just mentioned, the UX perspective, I just. Didn't see anything I liked. So I did the thing that probably wasn't, isn't the right business move to make. And dedicated time and risk bug exposure to roll my own thing from scratch. I feel like just from a purely business perspective, like long-term, if you're talking long games, right, like, and you're thinking about it, this is what I'm doing, this is my job, this is what I do, it makes it, it makes a ton of sense. To me, it's not, and you, I think the, your progression, right. Cause you use the off the rack stuff and then it progressed to this because it didn't meet your needs. Like that makes a lot of sense to me in particular about the UX, because if like you're seeing your students need a certain experience and you're not able to deliver that. Also, I imagine, I can't imagine how frustrated it is from your, as a, like an expert marketer and like personalization and segmentation and all that fun stuff that you do and just not being able to, has to be incredibly frustrating. Yeah. I mean, it's just, it all seems, I hate to say it, but it seems like a lot of these tools were designed by developers. I was just looking at a really big one the other day and I was looking at a sales page or something. And the call to action you could tell was there was an if else of like either access the course or a button that says you don't have access to a buy it. And the button that, cause I obviously didn't buy the course. I wasn't logged into anything. Was that else that, that said you don't have access to buy it, but they were speaking to me as if I was a logged in user who didn't currently have access to the product rather than something. I think that could have been more effective to get me to as somebody who is not authenticated, not a customer of anything, get me to be, don't make it just so I don't know if what I'm saying is making sense, but it was just very much like you could tell it was a literal, if else that the button copies the same, if you're logged in and bought something else, but didn't buy that. It's the same copy for them as it would be for somebody who is totally unknown and hasn't bought anything. And it's just a little stuff like that, that I would as a marketer, I'd be like, ah, there's some copy differences. I'd probably want to include, show one, one set of copy to somebody who's already a customer, but not a customer of that versus somebody who's not a customer at all. In programming lingo, you would have a switch statement versus an if else statement, right? It would be a nice, a beefy switch statement. Could probably get away with an if else, that might work too, but yeah. Flip it on its head, but like more options and just, it's just, it's the little things, it's the details at the end of the day, and I think that a lot of times if I'm just going to get something out there and push it, and I think people are in that disappointed also because they'll think about it. I'm going to create this course. People tell me I should, I'm an expert. I'm going to record the videos. I'm going to post the videos and then they land on crickets. And this is why to me, most, almost everything I see out there is, is really focused on the marketing, right? Like marketing will fix your problems. And I sometimes think that's maybe not the approach that like marketing isn't, it's important, but like the stuff we were talking about earlier, where you're developing and you're consulting and you're working with students and you're doing the live stuff and you're iterating and developing over time, and then you're posting it online for people to go, you'll, like it ends up marketing itself, like we were talking about, right? With the word of mouth versus just creating something and then you get nothing, why aren't people buying my videos? It's because they don't understand it or it doesn't feel like it's for them or that sort of thing. So you've been able to go in and create a platform that accomplishes both from a marketing perspective and a delivery perspective, and you can iterate on it and it'll fit the structure of any future courses that you might want to put out there and you can change it up. Yeah. You do everything yourself, like technically. I do. Is that challenging? What's your tech stack currently? How, how did you build, create and sell? So I built, so historically I'm a, I'm a Ruby guy, right? So rails is my thing I've been using for many years, but I haven't touched it. Haven't kept on top of, or I haven't really done anything with Ruby. And I haven't looked at any new stuff in rails for probably five or six years. Cause before, or the last time I really touched rails was with planscope, which is a SaaS site I used to have. And then I moved on to W freelancing, which is just a WordPress site. So I moved off of needing Ruby, but I'm actually, so the create and sell stack is a Statamic, which I only use because I thought the site was nice. And I think like Justin Jackson or somebody tweeted it and I looked at it and I was like, Oh, this looks like a nice CMS and it was built off of Laravel, which I'd heard things about. So yeah, it's built on Statamic, which is really a layer, a CMS layer on top of Laravel. Is it, you said you're using view. Are you doing like the full front end or is it all just templated and related to the framework that you're using? No, I'm using it. So I'm not using view for this. I'm actually using, cause there's not a lot of JavaScript on the, in the course for itself, so I'm using Alpine JS to do all that, which gives me view stuff with kind of reminds me of a little bit like jQuery or something, maybe less robust where you get just a little bit of interactivity, but it's lightweight and you're not sending a bunch of JavaScript to the client. So yeah, you're not taking a bunch of like event listeners or anything like that. You're just adding to dom nodes, like when this gets clicked, do this or whatever. So I'm using Alpine JS for things like toggling lesson completion stuff and making it so like when you click a chapter, it'll then tell Wistia's JavaScript API to jump to this chapter or whatever in the viewer, in the, in the player, there's not a lot, not a ton of JavaScript going on the front end client side, there's some other stuff too. Like I'm using, I know you have thoughts on this, but I'm using paddle selling stuff because I, now that I'm in Europe, I think VAT collection is nightmare and Stripe still doesn't make it easy. I just didn't want to think about any of that stuff. So I went with paddle and so I'm needing to do stuff like that. Because if you think about technically, if I'm selling a course, I've got a Statamic CML page and ended up building my own, like it's effectively like a repeater, if you've used advanced custom fields with WordPress or anything like that, where I can add like the testimonial block and I can add a CTA block and I can add a comparison or a right for you, not right for you block and all these different things, and then just, it'll then be fed into the CMS and then spit out the compiled HTML. So every course has a sales page that I host, and then you click the buy button and it prompts a little paddle pop up. And then there is also like the webhook stuff. So when paddle, when somebody buys, I had to have a controller that is a larval controller that when they buy gets all that information and then finds or finds or creates their user in Statamic. So you can log in and access the course, adds them to the thing they just bought and also phones over to ConvertKit and segments them the right way. So I had to roll all that for, to make it work. So it's not just the course where it's also the like sales page, the purchase flow and everything in between. How do you balance the content creation, like actually creating the courses and then working on the platform itself? Cause they're really two different, two totally different products in mind. I don't actively tend to the platform. I mean, it's really, if I'm adding a new feature to like when I added the chapter stuff, I mean, I just spent a day or something in that, but it's not some, I'm not like dedicating X many hours a week or anything to the platform. It's just, it works and it's there. And I read it once. And then when I need to add new content, it's just a matter of going into Statamic CMS backend and going to the course and adding content or changing stuff or whatever else. And I've built it in such a way where, like when I'm adding, say I'm adding a new lesson, it's, and this is where it's similar to a hosted thing. I type in the knit titled lesson. I give it the Wistia ID for embedding. I give it length since I didn't, I could have coded something that would query Wistia and say, how long is this video? But I didn't bother writing that. So I manually enter in how long the video has changed. So, yeah, exactly. And, but if I was doing a platform teachable or something, yeah, I would write that and not make people need it. I think there's like this idea, cause you've built a personal platform and you are currently the sole creator, but then there's like the platform as a platform, as a service, and then there is like the marketplace, right? Like Gumroad or something where they're providing like the, the bazaar where you can browse and go through. So there's like different layers. And I think personally, from my experience, create something for yourself where you're the only user is much, much simpler than creating a marketplace for infinity users. That I think is one of my frustrations too, with the hosted stuff is like they try to do, they're all trying to be kitchen sinks and they're all trying to come up with their own sales page builder thing, along with, they want to capture payments and this and that, even do email. I much prefer, I just want my sales page to be a normal webpage that I, I don't want to be constrained into your things. Cause I've seen a lot of the sales pages that these hosted platforms have. And they're also like, you can tell they're all the same template. They're not very, in my mind, they're not really always that optimized for actual, for sales. It's like title, short description, and then like a table of lessons or something, and I guess you can do other stuff probably, but it just seems like a lot of the courses I see, it's just very much like, it's not the Amy Hoy 30 by 500 style sales page that I think you and I favor. It's just dream fix. Yeah, exactly. It's just, it's very featured, a feature, like these are the features of this product kind of thing of these are the module. This is the module hierarchy. These are the lessons under each module and stuff you shall get. Yeah, exactly. So I just, I would much rather just say like a sales page. It's just a webpage. I'm going to develop it. I'm going to find out how to capture money from people. And then, yeah. So I think if I were to use a hosted one, I would basically just use it simply for the hosting part, ideally for delivery. Yeah. For the delivery of fulfillment. And I'm not a basically ignore everything else. What's your most audacious goal with create and sell or your courses in general? Do you have anything like a long-term audacious goal that you have in your mind? Well, the only thing with create and sell it's, it's interesting. Cause when I, so I started last February, February of 2021, and it was really just a place for me to rant about stuff that wouldn't be appropriate to rant about under the right message block. I started writing that stuff. And they're really the only product I really could put because mastering drip mastering, ConvertKit, we're all technically housed under wfreelancing.com, which made no sense because most of the people buying it, weren't buying it to better their freelancing. You'd have software shops buying it or something like that or creators or whatever. I just thought, okay, I'll start a website. I'll send out a weekly newsletter and I'll move over this thing from w freelancing to it. So that's where it started. The problem is it's a very expensive and premium course. And it's very specific to an advanced level thing to do with one software product, right? So what I'm doing now is I'm trying to fill in the gaps and think what are other products that can create the product funnel that lead to something like mastering ConvertKit. So that's what I'm working on now. Hence like that workshop that the workshop I referenced earlier, which was really a beginning marketing workshop, which is something I've never done before. I'd never done anything on like how to start doing email marketing from scratch the right way. You wouldn't jump in headfirst in a course like mastering ConvertKit. If you were just started sending your first email or whatever. You could, it's going to be, I'm not seeing people try, but it's like a lot of information to absorb. So I'm just trying to think of, I'm trying to be maybe more modular or modular is the wrong word, but more like mastering ConvertKit is a big product. And I'm now thinking of, Oh, wouldn't it be fun to do like a Westbos style, like a liquid for marketers type thing, where it's just like a proper thing on all the stuff you can do and the limitations of liquid, but not targeting devs, but treating it like, like a learning to code course, but the coding language happens to be liquid. Yeah. So that's something I'm going to, I'm going to probably do at some point soon. And it's like little things like that, that won't be like a massive 20 hour course, like mastering ConvertKit, it'll instead be like a shorter primer on, Hey, if you're not a coder, but you want to do more than like sticking somebody's first name in, here's what you can do. And here's how, and here's how you go about learning how to code by making your emails a little more dynamic. Do you consider adding other, other experts into create and sell or just mostly going to focus on Brandon? I think I'd like to, but I just don't know how to be honest, if that makes sense. I'm not sure from the partnership level, how to do all that stuff. And from like the, then I need to figure out like, how do I trust that they'll do what I need them to do rightly and based on how we do it. I mean, it adds a ton of complexity, right? If you're doing it, I mean, you can mostly trust yourself and then the quality levels and then that'll meet your goals and all that fun stuff. But as soon as you bring anybody else into the mix, partners are, partners are hard. Right? Like, yeah, exactly. So I think like, I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I, and especially if I ever, one of the interesting things I'm doing now is I'm capturing what ESP somebody uses when they sign up, so email service provider and convert gets 30%, but I'm getting a lot of like active campaign and stuff and I don't know anything about active campaign, so would it make sense for me to partner with somebody who does know something about active campaign and do like a mastering active campaign probably, but I, I just don't, I don't know if I have the energy to do that, to be honest. And it's almost a little bit of management at that point, right? Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, but I wouldn't write it off, but I just haven't put much thought to it. Brandon, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me and I like can't express my, my gratitude enough in terms of, of how your courses and your just willingness to share and let people explore and even sometimes piggyback off of, of your work and I think it's just generous and I love the spirit and, and I look forward to seeing what you do next. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks Joel.\")\n",

Your work is something that, that we dug into and it's helped us in my business and getting like a better understanding of visual design and your course is excellent and kind of was a Eureka moment for us in terms of using Notion as a platform for delivering courses. And before we get into that, I have this little icebreaker where I'm just curious. How do you, when you sit down and you're about to learn something new, something complex, whether it's technical or otherwise, what is your approach to learning a new complex subject? Oh, that's a great question. I'm typically kind of full immersion. Watch all the YouTube videos, read everything I can. I guess it really depends on what it is. If it's something highly specialized and I realize, okay, this is way, way too complex for me, I'm going to have to have someone else do this for me. But either, even if it comes to that, I still think it's helpful to gain as much knowledge as you possibly can, just even to ask questions to the expert that you may bring in or learn enough to do it on your own. I think that's interesting. And I don't think anybody else has answered this question, hire somebody. And that makes me really curious. What does that look like? You'll get in and you're like, I need a specialist to come in and either do this for you or teach you, or how does that work when you get to that point? I'm, I'm kind of actually thinking in the world of like home renovation stuff right now, and so like, for example, we have a lot of concrete we needed to get poured and we were like looking for a very specific texture. So I'm like, I'm watching videos. I'm messaging people on Instagram who have done like a concrete work that looks amazing. I'm like, what finish are you using? And so I'm like transferring that information to the person that we eventually hired, but on the tech side, like I can write some JavaScript and I can do a few things with code, but if it gets too complex or if there's databases involved or really any backend work, that's just, I know that I don't have the efficiency or the time to invest, to go down that path myself. So I will end up just either hiring someone, just literally reaching out to someone that I know has done that type of work before, or kind of reach out to my network to see if I can find something. It's funny for me. Cause when you talk about home improvement and DIY and that sort of thing, and I'm always like, sure I can hang drywall, but I can't do it very well because I don't do it every day. And there's like a certain point where you're like, well, I could just hire an expert and get this done. I don't want to be an expert in this subject. I need to just get an expert to handle this and that's it. Or hire an expert to learn from too, which is always an option as well. Yeah. And I think that's, it's more of a, I don't know, five year question, 10 year question, like, do I want to be good at this? And do I want to rely on myself for this? Or do I know, is it just a one-time thing? Does it need to be good enough for now, or I'm not going to start a drywall career anytime soon. So if I have to repair, you're not looking to have a concrete business. If I have to repair a wall that my son drove his skateboard into or whatever, you know, I can do that. Well, and in that case, I'm like, well, you're going to have to get on the YouTube and learn how to texture the wall and decorate it yourself. Cause you know, and then it's a question of how long do I want that hole to be there? There you go. And how bad do you want it to look afterwards? So speaking of like hiring experts and to me, in some ways, if you buy a book or take a course, you are starting a relationship with an expert and learning from them up to and including like direct, direct mentorship, right? Do you take courses? Are you a course taker? I have taken the occasional course related to like business or I've taken some Ramit Sethi courses. Those are always good. And yeah, I really kind of, I haven't taken a ton of courses, but I think usually for me, it's like trying to find that a lot of times a course is like. Wrapped around like a couple of key principles. And if you can, sometimes you need even a book, you read a 300 page book and then you can break it down into like these three main things that they kept telling stories about and hammering in the points and so, and if someone were to just read three bullet points to you, it wouldn't stick as much. Yeah. Just flip by. Yeah. And so, so I think it's kind of like, for me, it's like trying to figure out like, what are, what are those two sentences that I paid a couple thousand dollars for to like really make it stick and be meaningful because that was kind of in the realm of things I was trying. I know like patterns and design is important to you. And I mean, design in the broad sense, not in the kind of the visual sense. And I'm wondering like what goes into a really good course from a design perspective that would help make it sticky and make it something that would last and be useful for you long-term. You mean from like creating a design course? No, just when you, if you've taken a course and what, basically what makes a good course from your perspective as a learner? Yeah. I think the best courses would have a very strong point of view in terms of like who it's trying to teach and what level they're at first of all, like solid baseline, but this course is for X person. You can add any number of variables to make it, but then also like you have your starting point and then I think the best course would know exactly what the finishing point is as well. So you're taking someone from A to B and you're getting them there as fast as possible without sacrificing inequality. And then once, once they're at the B or finish line location, what evidence shows that they now are indeed there. I think some, some courses are going to give you the, like kind of points you in that direction and maybe it's, I'm not going to take a master class on throwing a curve ball and then all of a sudden join the MLB in six months because it took this course. I'm gonna have an idea of how to get there. So I think there, and there's also some like expectations to set as well, but I think that's how I viewed a really good course. Just like starting point, ending point, and being able to, to at least speak to or prove, show evidence that you've achieved that. Yeah, that kind of, but transfer skills where you can apply it to new situations and that you truly understand it because now you can take that and use it in your day to day. Right. How do you describe shift nudge, which is your course and it's focused on kind of web development and visual design and mobile development. How do you describe that to folks when they are making everything that goes into the visual side of design, like all of the tiny details to make beautiful interfaces, so everything from typography, color layout, all of those, like really nerdy, tiny details that go into just making something look beautiful as it relates to interface design and product design. So for the longest time I was, I had written an entire curriculum or at least the outline for both a kind of like a product slash user experience design course and a visual design course. Cause I was like, oh, this is what I do. I don't really, I'm never necessarily only focused on the visuals. I'm always keeping in mind, like how that relates to the product information density. You know what, and there's always a part of both sides of your brain that's thinking about the experience and how it looks, so I was thinking, well, I'll just, I'll just make a course how I would normally approach a product. And then as I talked to more people and I consulted with other people, as I was trying to put everything together, this one lady told me, she was like, there might be people who already know a lot about user experience and they just want to know, you know, all of the visual things and you can, it's a lot easier to drill down on a specific subject than it is to teach a really broad. And I was like, and I'd already invested so much time in putting together the outline and I'd written half the curriculum and then I ended up like cutting it in half and then redoing the entire outline based on some of that feedback, that that's a really long example, explanation of what my course is about, but that's kind of how it came to be at least then. So now it's easier to explain because it's, it really is. Those really nerdy details about what makes great design for interfaces. And I, there is like a user experience lens and you will gain some insight into my design process, but it's all about the visual side. And that's kind of how I explain it now, because that's the process that led me to create it that way. One of the things that struck me, like as a learner, taking your course was when you get into it and the initial sections felt like a really good introduction to design in the broad sense, right? Like if you design as something that, that like there's visual and user experience and instructional design and design is just a part of our life with intention, if you will. But you had a really good kind of worldview that you exposed to folks front, which was really appreciated. Awesome. Yeah, I spent, I mean, looking back at like the outline and the curriculum and the lessons, it really, it almost seems simple. Like, oh yeah, of course you'll have a starting module. And then of course these would be the initial lessons, but I, it took me so long, when you think of just blank canvas, it was like, I must've spent six months or more on just the outline and trying to piece it and cause I really wanted it to be really valuable, really impactful, and I was like, there's no way I can just jump right into to font size without some type of like meaningful. Here's how I think about design. Here's my mindset for design, for learning, choosing software. Here's my design process, some overarching things. And I think that also makes a good course as well. I think you almost need to, I, at least with the bigger topics that you're trying to, maybe you're a lot of people are trying to switch careers and interface designer or UI, so I think that requires a lot more than, okay, here's how the rectangle tool works in Figma. And here's, we're going to jump straight into making frames and all this stuff. You kind of need a little bit of like a introduction and maybe not so much for here's how a course about animating objects with JavaScript, you might not need a big introduction other than maybe like, here's why you might do these things. So I think it, it also just kind of made me feel good, you know, in a selfish way. It's like, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to, a lot of people have this, like, I don't know why in the UX world, maybe even in the just designers in general, you could even broaden that to just people in general are extremely opinionated, especially with their process, JavaScript framework or not, or Figma or sketch, or should you wireframe or not? And yeah, so I just kind of want to lay it out all on the table. Like, this is what I think about these things, and this is what you need to keep in mind while I'm teaching this content, because if you disagree from the very beginning, maybe you might need to just get a refund, look elsewhere, because this is kind of like my approach. And if we're not like hitting it off and nodding our heads together in agreement at the very beginning, then it might not work out. I say you hadn't me nodding my head vigorously in the first parts of it. And I think what's interesting is what you talk about. And it's like a practitioner that's been doing this for a long time, has built up a system and worldview over time. And I talked to my friend, Marie Powell, and who helps people build notion workspaces as an educator. And at first it was like, here's the full, the kitchen sink and people would just get kind of sad and confused and you can't even start and then has switched sense to like, let's build a system together because you were going to have your own system to understand this. You can't just drop into my system. You need to develop your own, but here's the kind of the initial building blocks to start climbing the ladder. Yeah, absolutely. You mentioned talking to people and I thought that was interesting. And I was curious about your research process specifically for shift nudge, but I would assume it's kind of similar for other projects as well. What's your research approach when you start thinking about a new product or course? Yeah. I don't know why every time if I've ever done a, like a work, a design workshop at a conference or even just shift nudge students, even asking like user research, I think there's like a, maybe there's a stigma around quote unquote, user research would be this like extremely formal process. And, oh, I read this agile framework for systematically interviewing users. And it sounds like almost like, am I doing this wrong? Like it, I don't know. It just, I, so I like to just think of research as just simply asking questions, um, and just reaching out to people, asking them questions or being that information and then making decisions based on those answers. And that's as simple as I, I mean, that's, I guess, as complex as I like to get with, I like to just ask people questions and listen to their answers. And maybe they're a little more open-ended. Maybe they're a little more leading depending on what I'm trying to figure out, but I, I first, I think the very first question that I asked about this particular course was sending an email, like research survey to my email list. And it was less about like, what do you want out of a visual design course, but more, it was like, Hey, here's four course ideas that I'm thinking of. That would be, I know that I could teach these things. Which one are you gravitating more towards? And I think it was along the lines of like product design, like systematic processes, all things related to like creating a product from beginning to end, specifically like for freelance work, contract work, things like that. And then the second one was interface design, all the bits and pieces of learning how to make beautiful interface, which those two are definitely like really related, but I think you could, you can definitely break them apart. The other one was like designers learning CSS. I was thinking about teaching like a CSS course or something just specifically from a designer's perspective, like forget about all the complex stuff. Like how can we wrangle some CSS to make things look good in a browser? And then the last one was like a, some, at the time I had like an introduction to icon design course that I had just released is actually still active. Intro to icons.com. I was thinking about creating maybe like a premium version of that one, because that one's free. And then based on the, I guess the results from the survey, it was pretty, the majority was like obvious. Everybody on my email list at least wanted an interface design course and followed like by a close second product design, so I just decided to go with that one because Hey, I'm going to, I want it to be successful for both the people that are already kind of like waiting on something and also just from a, it's interesting trying to balance like student success and business success. Those aren't necessarily always easy to align. So I wanted to make sure that was as aligned as possible from the very beginning, because it's really tough to change from doing consulting work and design for client and then be able to like focus fully on like a really huge robust curriculum course, like shift nudge. So it was kind of daunting. I'm like this, if I screw this up, I'm gonna, I'm gonna like. That's material effects on you and your family basically. Yeah, exactly. You aren't new to developing products. You have a kind of a suite of products that you've released over the years. And I'm wondering, is creating a course different or do you approach it differently or is it similar in terms of just kind of, of fundamentally the approach and the research process? I think it, you could simplify it and say that it's similar with, I will say that the other products that I've released are extremely simple compared to a course, like the little contrast color picker thing is extremely simple. A little app, the flow kit stuff that I've done is pretty simple. You're drawing arrows, one, you're checking colors, one, you're drawing. There's not a lot of complexity to it at the high level, but with the course, I think the hardest thing, the most complex thing that I encountered when developing a course is just, I like to think of myself as a pretty decent. Here I can explain things. I'm, I like to step-by-step explain things to peers and clients and day-to-day work with clients. Even I feel like a lot of it is teaching someone why we should go with this instead of that. So it was kind of a natural progression for me, but I found that one of the most difficult things was just trying to get out of my own head in terms of this should be for everyone or no, this should be just for this person or, oh, this lesson's stupid. This is, this sucks. Nobody's going to care about this. So I think, I don't know, maybe because it's more like you're putting more of your own knowledge on the table. I know it's, it's not necessarily all about a knowledge transfer. I think it's more about taking someone from point A to point B, whether that's with your own knowledge or with your own resource curating or the other thing, but I think it's like a more of a, I don't know, it's like a, it produces a lot of anxiety and while you're trying to do it, you're like, oh my gosh, like I'm going to talk myself out of this. Whereas a product, I think you're, maybe you're detached a little bit more personally. Yeah. It's more like a tool versus, I don't know, like you're trying to help a person achieve an objective either way. Like they use your tool to do this, but there is a lot more depth, I think, to the, to shift nudge over, over a plugin for Figma, for example, like that does a specific thing and it either does it or doesn't do it versus shift nudge, where it's a huge gradient of potential outcomes that people are seeking and it needs to kind of line up with all of those and effectively help them get from point A to point B and achieve whatever it is in their life, which certainly isn't like nobody wakes up and thinks I'm going to do, I'm going to take a course today. That's what I'm going to do. That's not what they're trying to do is take courses. They're actually trying to achieve something. So it's like this kind of a struggle to get them there again. Exactly. Yeah. I always love the drill and the hole analogy, or it's like, I'm going to wake up and use a drill today. And people are like, Oh, and actually you don't even want a hole. You just want the cord to go through the hole to power your laptop or, you know, what, that you can abstract it out like 10 different times. I don't know if we're ready to get into a jobs to be done discussion. Yeah, probably not. So, and just kind of related and it is related to that and other things. Do you have a, like, like a framework for instructional design or is that something you studied or how do you approach instructional design in general? Yeah, I don't have a great, let me look into my filing cabinet really quickly and pull out my 10 steps to instructional design, I think for me, I, I almost approached, I can draw some similarities between even user experience design and teaching someone how to use typography for interface design, I think, cause that in a way you're leading, you're trying to determine where someone is and where they're trying to go. And I'm just, I'm trying to apply that, I guess, to each lesson and each one, like one, I don't know, like one module, for example, is trying to take you from beginning to end. And then each lesson is like this little mini journey from A to B as well. I actually even consulted with this professor, a buddy of mine hooked me up with this professor of, I don't know if it was continuing education, some professor of education at Clemson university. And he was like in charge of the global education. So anyway, a lot of my curriculum and I had like a couple of hour long conversations with him. And he explained a lot of like his philosophy behind just education in general and the process. And I found it to be almost like as much of a therapy session for myself, as opposed, in addition to like instructional design learning, because it was like, okay, I'm not like, I'm not the grand knowledge holder that is bestowing upon. I'm so blessed and I'm bestowing all this knowledge on all these people. It's like, no, I'm just, I'm facilitating someone from not knowing to knowing. And whether that's through my own experience, some exercises or Hey, here's 10 articles that you can read. I think that made me feel a little bit better about the instructional design process, where it's like facilitating you to get from point A to point B versus bestowing my grand knowledge on you. It's funny. You said, I don't have a, I can't reach into my file cabinet and get a book called the 10 steps. Um, my favorite instructional design framework right now is literally called temps, 10 steps to complex learning. I think I saw you tweet that. And I think I bookmarked it and I was like, oh my gosh, I remember reading through like the overview and I was like, okay, this checks out. This sounds like a plea. What I did, even if it was like a happy accident. Yeah. I mean, I love, like, I love a good framework, like regardless. I always, I really love to get it. I honestly do too. And I think I could probably benefit from having a few more dual frameworks that I'm like legitimately trying to follow. Yeah. This one, and I've studied a few and this one just was like, Oh, this is it. And to me, and you mentioned this and I truly think there's a lot to this is user experience design is instructional design, and I think people sleep on instructional design and all of the research, cause there's a ton of research in that area and you could apply this to like product development in a very real way and it would benefit everybody involved. Exactly. I feel like even this is maybe farfetched, but like, even if you're like trying to give someone directions somewhere, like some people are extremely bad at giving directions and it's, I almost like, cause in order to give really good directions to drive somewhere or to where I'm at in the stadium or wherever, whatever you're trying to do to give directions, like you almost have to imagine that close your eyes and imagine where that person is, where they're driving, where they're walking, okay, you're going to see this sign. When you see that, take a look. I feel like it's the exact same thing when you're designing an experience for a product that you're setting up a course and trying to guide someone through that whole process. And I think it, it does go back to like communication and instructional design. Even though the root of graphic design is called or considered communication design and you're trying to communicate things visually. So I, yeah, I think there's, there's a lot of frameworks and things that are maybe overlooked or it's like, Oh, this has actually existed for decades and no one's really regarded it because it doesn't have a cool, trendy title on it. Yeah. People like to rename and reinvent. That's something that I've noticed in technology in particular. And it's always a cycle of like, well, we're going to come up with new names for these patterns that have existed for 75 years, because that's how we build our own name, is by renaming something that already exists. Yep. Totally. So I'm curious, and you've mentioned this idea of getting people from point A to point B and like understanding what their success is and what point B is for the learner, and I'm curious, how do you know when a learner has achieved what their, they've set out to do with shift nudge, what's the kind of indicator for success that you look for? Oh, that's tricky because I mean, I'm ultimately looking for great design, handling typography really well, color, all those things together, layout, nice spacing, negative space, all the things that, and it's weird, it's, I found it extremely difficult to take, uh, some, I mean, there are definitely some objective principles when it comes to design, but some of those can be like, if you know them really well, you can actually break them and make something a little more interesting. Yeah. And so that makes it really difficult to like objectively say, this is exactly what I'm looking for, because if someone's really talented or really skillful, they could check seven things off the list, but break three intentionally because of a certain reason. And then it's like, wow, this is even better than I thought it would be. So it's almost, it's tough to like, have a specific rubric for someone to go through and say like, yes, this satisfies all. It's one of those things where it's like, you listen to music, listening to music is probably another good example. It's like, is this song good or is it bad? And it depends on who you ask. You could objectively say like, okay, yeah, well the chord progression is in the key of E. So that's a check mark. Algorithmically or whatever, right? Like, like this is algorithmically good versus something that, that has soul. And, and so like, I think music is probably a really good example because some people love a certain song, some people hate a certain song, but whether or not someone likes it or not, it could algorithmically ask all of those, those check marks. So it's like, I mean, it's kind of a smoke and mirrors when you're trying to determine whether or not something is good. And as it relates to design, I am objectively trying to check these things off in my list, but also like trying to, I'll never get away from my personal opinion about whether or not I think something is, is good or not. Even if I've seen things that are, that look amazing, but it's like, it actually looks like you might have kind of ripped off this other brand a little bit. And it, I was going to say like one of the drawbacks to this algorithmic approach where this is objectively good, according to the algorithm is now every single startups and landing page looks the exact same and flows the exact same way and uses the same like illustration style and same color palettes and you get the same, which you see in music too, right? Like, okay, this is what a hit looks like. So keep making, and like you remove that aspect, that advancement, like a challenging design or a challenging song. And you listen to it the first time and you're like, Ooh, no, no thanks. But you listen to it the fifth time and you're like, okay, okay. And you start to feel it. And then like, how do you achieve that? Or even impart that onto others would be a, that's a lifelong challenge probably. Totally. And I think it, I think, yeah, I think that's really where the music, I don't know, analogy comes to life because you can almost track any decade of music. And there's usually like a pivotal moment where I'm, when you said, when you were talking about songs, I was immediately thinking of like the hair band.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"power ballads of the eighties. And it's like, this is how this is a band in the eighties. Then all of a sudden Nirvana comes along and they're like way different, grungy. And then all of a sudden alternative music is born and now everyone's doing that. I think maybe they were all checking their own algorithmic boxes. Yeah, I think there is a certain amount of personal taste. I think we look for even in design, I think being able to express personality of either yourself or a brand or a product in a genuine way, I think that is what makes, you know, great design. In addition to all of the fundamentals, if you're able to project that in a way that represents personality in a way, because I think you wouldn't necessarily say, this is the ideal type of human being. They are this gender, this height, this, because I think it's extremely problematic, extremely. And I think the same thing would apply to maybe design, maybe music. I think you're not ever, you'll never make something that applies and works for everyone. And I think, yeah, it's that interesting of objective and subjective kind of coming together the same way that two people might not get along that well, but then they both have their own best friends that they hit it off with really easily. Have you seen any sort of like outside of their designs look good? Have you had any inspiring success stories come out of students that have taken shift nudge? Oh, yeah, definitely. I've had, so when I first started, I started reaching out to a bunch of the beta students for like, Hey, what are you, I basically started kind of trying to like inquire if anyone had anything decent to say about the course. And a lot of people were just posting stuff in Slack, like, Oh, I love this thing and this thing. But I had one guy in particular was reaching out to me and he was like, Hey, I've always been a UI designer. But now that I'm adding UI and visual design to my arsenal, I'm up for like a. I think he said he was up for like a salary increase of $20,000 because now he could effectively do this. And then he, he was able to use that in another interview and he was able to, I think he told me he ended up making like $50,000 more at another job than, than he was previously. And he attributed it to his new like UI skills because previously he was. Like user research wireframe only kind of, that's always the one that stood out to me just because it had a, it's easy to like put a $10 amount. So I was like, Hey, that's quite the return on the investment, but I've got like, I have this, the page on my website. If you go to shift nudge.com slash reviews, it's maybe a little outdated, but I, anytime I got a testimonial, I would put it on here and, and it was just like, it became almost like fuel for me to finish the full course. Cause I was like, okay, whenever I think this sucks, I can come back and read what I copied and pasted from one of my Slack messages and I'm like, okay, this is not the worst thing I've ever done in my life. I'm actually, because I guess it's easy to like, look at a polished landing page and think, Oh, they really have it together. Matt's doing amazing, but you're still human. You still have self-doubt and you're, you need some like encouragement. So yeah, that's where I kind of keep my library of when you need a little boost time. Just to get you over the finish line and be like, this is good. People like it. It's fine. Keep going. So you mentioned beta students and I think that's really interesting. And I was wondering, how did you test this course and how do the feedback from actual students maybe change your design or alter what you had originally assumed about the course? Yeah. So I think I decided pretty early on that I wanted to do like kind of a limited quantity beta student group. And I also decided early on that I wanted them to be paying customers as beta students because I had, I created a, I did create another course back in like 2015 or so, and I had a beta group, but it was like, anyone could join if they wanted to. I did just, Hey, you can sign up for this week and you can join. I think it, it felt like it kind of fizzled out. And I knew that if I had paying customers, they would give me real feedback because they put their money and invested it. So I decided to do kind of a simple landing page. I charged for it and I only let, I think I said I was going to do like, I was going to like open it up for a couple of weeks and either the time was going to close and then I would just begin the beta then, or I would close it if up to a hundred people joined. And so I actually, the very first time I did it, I had a hundred people joined before the enrollment even ended. So I just shut it down. And then I was like, Oh my gosh, like it's okay. This might be a viable business. Number two, people are interested and also they're excited about joining that. So we all get in a Slack group together and I committed to, to basically reviewing every single student's work myself and giving either written or video feedback on everyone's work. And I didn't realize how much of a, how time intense that would become. Quite the chore. And if you've dug around in the course, you can see the critique vault is kind of like a never ending sea of loom videos of like reviewing pre students work. And so the way I had it, I basically come up with a fairly tight curriculum based on my press, like reaching out to people, asking people things. I would send people my outline and kind of try to get feedback. And then I had a, I would say I had about third of the course recorded and then maybe only a half of that actually edited and ready to view. And so, and that was actually one of the reasons why I started using notion because I was like, how am I going to, I don't want to transfer all of this undone material to some teaching platform when it's not quite even ready and I'm not ready to like invest in this new platform and commit to something else because notion was working really well as just a way to organize my thoughts and to create pages and sub pages really quickly. So I was like, I'm just going to add all of these beta students as guests to the notion workspace. I can like change things really quickly. They can leave comments. If something's confusing, they can like write them. They can either message me in Slack or make a comment in notion and I can either answer their question or I can like change the content on the fly to make it more applicable to clarify any points that might've been confusing in the video and so during that beta period, people were going through, I would let them know like, Hey, module four is now available. I got all the videos done and people would, they would go in and they would make comments on certain things and say, Hey, what did you mean right here when you said system fonts? Can you explain that a little bit more? And I'm like, oh, okay. I need to actually go a little bit more into detail because like you're, there's always the idea that you're cursed with knowledge, so you kind of forget that there might be some things that people don't know, the beginning of, yeah. It's like, what are system fonts? I don't know. I didn't know that San Francisco was only available on the, on iOS or Mac and not on Microsoft, whatever. So like little things like that, I would, I was able to go in and update the content and if maybe I missed most of the pages, the lessons, they have a big video, 15 to 20 minutes, and then most of them also have like all the written content that I gathered in preparation for that lesson as well, so I didn't bother going in and like changing a bunch of the videos, I would just go in and add supplemental material in the written section and that way I was able to, even if someone asked me a question later, I could at least link them to that section and I even ended up making another couple of lessons based on, you know, I kept getting questions about like layout issue or even as I was reviewing student work on the layout module, I was like, man, I'm finding myself explaining this concept over and over in a lot of the reviews and I, I didn't have a lesson on it, so I created a brand new lesson called layout connectors and I just, a little bit of a rougher, like loom video as like in response to everyone's work that I was reviewing and then I would, so I'm kind of think of the material as like a little bit of a living, breathing document that I can keep updating or I might find an interesting or tweet thread and it really relates to color or type fonts or whatever and then paste it in there, that way it's just kind of constantly being updated and somewhat more relevant than it would be otherwise. Has that feedback loop slowed down over time? Yeah, it definitely, it has slowed down and I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's because the content has become more polished or if the, maybe the, when I had the a hundred beta students, it was like very personal, it was like we were all in one big group and I would chat with them every day and now when the new enrollments come in, it's a, there's like a little bit more of a disconnect between the students and myself just simply because I do not have the physical bandwidth and the time to invest in the new students as I did when it was a much smaller group. You're bringing in design advisors now, so you're bringing in third parties to kind of handle some of that. And I was curious, has that, how's that worked out and how did, you know, like, how did you start to think about bringing other people into your house? Yeah, so I, like I said, with the students that signed up for the beta group, I was doing it all myself and then I actually was planning to release the public course in like March of 2020. But I think anyone who lived through March of 2020 knows that was a little bit of a hectic time. And I was like, there is no way I could possibly promote and an online course online during a protest, coronavirus, presidential stuff, and so I decided to do a second beta group and I was basically committed to another hundred students to my surprise. And then, so I had a, for almost all of 2020, I was doing nothing but trying to finish the course and also student reviews and I was just completely swamped. I knew my like public launch was coming up soon and I didn't promote that I was going to give feedback on everyone's work, but one of the mistakes I made when I recorded the course, I think I was in the mindset that it was like, Hey, I'm here, post a video in Slack, post your work in Slack. I'd love to check it out. I'd love to review it. And that's just not the case. Like I cannot, I don't have the time to review everyone's work that's getting posted and I almost went back and like re-edited the end of every video. That was one of the mistakes I made was like trying to let people know that, Hey, I'm going to be checking out your work every time you post. It worked up front, but then like when I had my first public enrollment, I was like it, the Slack channels where people were supposed to post their homework. It seemed like, like a water hose got left on overnight and it flooded the back. That's what those channels felt like to me. And I didn't even want to look at it. And so that's when I started thinking, I need to bring somebody else on. I've got to get somebody in here, like giving some reviews. And it was a, it was really helpful to have someone else come on. My, my first hire was this guy, Michael Rittering. He did amazing. I did like this huge interview process. I, I, I gave people like mock homework to critique in video form. And I would like giving them Amazon gift cards just for doing it. They try to find the, just the right person. This is an incredibly long explanation. No, I'm really curious about the details. And I love the idea of hiring and hiring people in the interview process is really quite interesting. And a lot of times, yeah, that's how I hire also. Yeah. So I basically was like, all right, Michael, check out this Slack channel. Like, don't get too scared. There is a pieces of homework and like, I don't care if you do loom videos. I don't care if you do want to do written content. I just want these students to feel like they have someone they can hear from. And so for, it took maybe like two or three months of him working every day or every week, at least to get in there and kind of like catch everyone up and at least give everyone like a piece of feedback. And then I was like, oh man, this is great. I'm going to get like, I'm going to get like six more design advisors, maybe on a much, like, I think Michael was doing roughly 20 hours a week from, and I was like, maybe I could get like six more design advisors doing like maybe five hours a week or so, and so I did another big kind of like hiring outreach and I wanted it to be like a very, a very diverse amount of advisors, both in terms of not me and Michael are both white dudes. So I was like, that's enough for that for now. I also wanted to get like freelancers people. I had someone who was a product designer at Facebook, someone else who was at an agency, just a good mix of like really solid approach from all angles, advising on design because everyone has a slightly different angle in which they're going to give feedback. And so in my mind, this was like perfect. And so like for the second enrollment, I was actually actively promoted. You'll get feedback from all these design advisors. Then I have everyone listed out and, and it was, I thought it was going to be great, but what it did was it actually poured gasoline on a problem that I thought I had solved. The water hose turned into a fire hose. Oh my God, it wasn't water pouring into my backyard. It was actually gasoline. And then this new plant of mine was like a lighter. And, and so all of a sudden everyone is like posting even more, their expectations are even higher. And I made it like really nonchalant for the advisors. I'm like, yeah, come in. I want you to basically, it was like, I want you to try to do roughly 10 or 15 student reviews each week. You can do video, whatever, but there was no real like system in place. It was basically just students posting their work into a never ending feed of like Slack updates. Um, and I did have channels broken down into like modules and then it just became almost like unwieldy. It was like, no one could tell what was going on. None of the advisors knew if another advisor had already begun reviewing someone's work. None of the students knew when their work was going to get reviewed. Everything was getting lost in the mix. And then I had like some advisors needed to like take a two month break. Another one was like, oh, actually I can't be an advisor anymore. And I was like, oh my gosh, this is an absolute wildfire. And so I made a decision after six months, actually it might've been three or four months. I made this big announcement video and this really like as heartfelt of an apology as I could. And I even told people in the Slack group, I was like, if anyone, you know, we're way past the 30 day money back guarantee here, but I realized that some of you might've signed up just because you wanted all this feedback. So if anyone here wants to reach out to me and get a full refund, like I don't have any problem with that, just want to just let everybody know, like this is what I was expecting, this is what happened and I'm apologizing for this result because it was not what I intended. And so basically I was like, okay. At the end of June of, I think it was 2021, I'm basically stopping all design advising because it's just not working at all. And so I decided to create a new design advisor program that was actually a, it's like $99 a month currently. And it had like extremely rigid rules. Like you can submit one to two pieces of work each week through this Google form, and that goes into a notion database. And now my design advisors can check off whether they are reviewing it or not. And now that I have like, and I try to do the math based on like how many students the advisor could review and how much money that would cost me versus how much it would cost the student. And so that, that has solved a lot of the issues other than it's, I think it's probably, I don't even think, I know that it's costing me more money than it's making, I'm actually losing money on doing that right now. And so, but it's been such a, it was almost like, just thank God this nightmare is over. So I'm just going to like, let this ride out for a little while. Cause I think there's a lot of intrinsic value and like having the ability to get someone to review your work. When you turn on the gasoline fire hose, it also prompts you to really reconsider your systems. How are you going to adjust that? And it was like, you had unforeseen consequences for making promises that were difficult to deliver without a system in place. And now you've learned that you can do that. And like, like now you can decide, do I want to charge more for this? Is it worth keeping? I could charge more and actually make it, maybe it's profitable and this is a viable service. It's like maybe almost breaking even, which is totally fine. I really wanted this to be valuable for the students. And I know for a fact, if you have someone who is more experienced than you reviewing your work and giving you pointers, I mean, that is the ultimate for advancing your life. You're going to get better quicker. Absolutely. And so, cause I, I want people coming out of ship nudge to be amazing designers because that's kind of what they signed up for and I want to be able to say like, Hey, yeah, check out their work. Now they went through the course and this is what their work looks like now. So if people aren't getting better than, you know, then I'm not a good job with the content. So, but yeah, that's been a pretty big learning experience for the whole design advisor thing. And I think there's so many more directions you could take that with live cohorts instead of like monthly, month to month design advising something that I would be interested in exploring in the future, but yeah, it's, there's, yeah. It's been a lot. And so I've enjoyed like letting things simmer down and have a, and finalizing the system a little bit better before I venture into a new thing. If you're going to make a new large scale course, would you use notion again today? I probably would. I mean, there's other, like there's teachables and podias and all the way up to, and including like hiring a development team and designing your own platform, which I feel like would be something that they would pull at you a little bit. But you didn't do that. Instead you've used notion. And I think that's interesting. It was the first time I'd ever seen anybody use notion to deliver a course. And I was like, Oh my gosh. And since taking your course, we are using notion as a beta testing ground for those courses because it is like really great for that. But then like going all in and saying, this is my course platform that we're not quite there yet, but I think it's really fascinating and curious about that experience. Yeah. I think that notion is not great for larger, more scalable courses, things that you would want to scale. Their API still does not work with like automated invites. So every single person that has ever joined Shivnaj, I have manually added them to the notion guest list. And that's been quite the, quite the task. I'm still doing that myself every single time. And what's funny is when I built, when I did my first course in 2015, before I launched that course, I also designed and developed my own course platform. So you've been down that road. Yeah. I went down that road and I had a developer partner because I'm not a backend developer. Yeah. At some point you got to have a database if you're doing that. So yeah, yeah. We had this, we had a really sweet little system. It's still a great, like the student experience, it was like tracking progress. It was a great little like student experience, but it didn't handle like chargeback, like all the things that go along with like some kind of credit card processing thing was just like a nightmare and yeah, so there was a lot that I needed from my end on the admin side and I was like, I can't bug my developer every time I need this tiny little change push to the code. And I think that's what, I think that's what led me to using Notion was because I had that experience last time and I tried to get so automated and so fancy and so technical and so complex with my system that I lost sight of traffic and. Customers. And when you get bogged down into building your platform and building your system and the technical aspects, cause it's kind of fun in some ways. And oh yeah, absolutely. It's a trade off and you're detracting from something else you could be spending time on. For sure. And it was like, as a designer who loves to build things, I'm like, man, this is great, this is such a cool, how I'm writing all the front end code and I'm just having a blast, I'm like, wait a second, this is, I'm losing focus here. But then we were like, oh yeah, we could, maybe we'll turn this into software and then we'll try to find, but that's like, Oh, now you're going to white label it and distribute it. Exactly. And we went down that road a little bit too. And then ultimately just kind of was like, this is not working out. I really just want to get a successful course going first. And then I did that kind of desire to build some kind of like course platform was still kind of like flicker in the back of my mind, but I'm not sure if I'll ever want to go down that road or not. Well, that's what I was wondering too. Now that you have like fully vetted Shift Nudge, like you've gone through all this feedback loop, you've had all this, is Shift Nudge going to stay on Notion or would you be tempted to like evolve that into, to something else or like the, I guess, or work on something new? Yeah, I think, I think that, uh, if Notion added a number of features that made it maybe easier to manage the kind of like the people who could view things and like feedback, like even the feedback stuff, like, like you can't get that level of integration that might be nice for your learning. Right. I think, I think for, for what I did and what I'm doing now, it's still working and I'm, I feel like it's a bit of like scotch tape and bubble gum right now, but that's okay. And I think if I, I'm definitely planning to, I always wanted Shift Nudge to be more of like the umbrella brand for new things. And so eventually I will likely come up with a new course under the Shift Nudge brand, but maybe the course that's now known as Shift Nudge, maybe it gets a new name or maybe it just is called visual design and there's another one called whatever. And so I think as that stuff starts to scale, it could, I mean, I know for sure it'll get more complex, but gosh, I don't think I want to go down the route of like building and developing my own software cause that's just a lot. It is a lot. It's super expensive too. And then you're maintaining that software over time, fighting software entropy and all that fun stuff that goes along with custom software. And I didn't understand that when I was a consultant, but for the last 10 years I've been paying, like writing checks for custom software and you're like, wow, this is very expensive. Yes, totally. And you're doing that instead of focusing on the teaching and the kind of this, like it's involved, everything's interweaved, but like the student outcomes, right, and if you can achieve student outcomes inside of a system like Notion that you don't have to also maintain, then like, is that enough? I've thought about doing other things that would maybe I, the student experience more than my own experience of like hosting a course. Like I thought about maybe I'll come up with some, maybe I'll get a developer to help me build some like really cool certificate of completion, authentication system, and there's maybe like, maybe we do like embedded certificates or some kind of like interactive thing that would be like cool and fun, that like, would be like a way that students could show off their certificates as opposed to me just sending them some PDFs. So little things like that would be a little bit more bite-sized, but I think that would add a lot more value, at least to the student experience, as opposed to like switching platforms, because they're going to be watching videos and reading content, no matter where the HTML is hosted. Yeah, exactly. Like it's a webpage and Notion is pretty good at building webpages, even though you can infinitely nest them and they get confusing if you are unfettered, you are using it in a constrained way that makes a lot of sense, I think. Matt, thank you so much for taking the time out. Thank you for creating Shift Nudge. It's helped me. It's helped my team and I know it's helped lots more people and we love it and love that you've created this and brought it into the world. So, so thank you so much. And again, thank you for hanging out with me today. Oh, thank you for having me. It's been awesome. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I want to talk to you about building free code camp and an education platform for developers. I was wondering first though, like what's your approach when you sit down to learn something new? I know that you're researching math and data science currently. And how do you, given the full scope of the internet, what do, what is your kind of approach to learning a new, a difficult topic during the pandemic? I learned a lot about music and music theory and composition and things like that. And so maybe I can walk you through how I went about doing that. So first I just kind of like go to like Wikipedia, like music composition or something like that, like some very, extremely high level, broad, you know, queries, and then I start to figure out, okay, like, I think like one of the things I like to do is try to find somebody who actually has gone through this process before, which you can often find like blog posts or, you know, YouTube blogs, like day 300 of me trying to learn this thing. And, and that can be really useful because often like you just go to their YouTube channel, you sort by like the most viewed video, and then you find that, and then it's usually somebody like, like everything I've learned from this process, and then you can skip a lot of the other stuff and you can, so the idea is you get a big picture, kind of 35,000 foot view of the thing you're trying to learn. In my case, it was just, you know, like how to play drums, how to play bass, how to compose like melodies and stuff like that. And then you just zoom in on the individual things. And as you're learning one thing, you'll say, oh, this is related to this. And, you know, it would be great if there was a cohesive linear curriculum for everything where you could just drop in and start at the beginning. And it was time tested and tons of people have been through it. And there was a community ready to help you through there. And I think in learning music, there are such things, but it's a little more scattered. There wasn't like a kind of multidisciplinary place where you could learn composition and music theory and, you know, actual playing and technique and stuff like that. But yeah, I just try to like, go from like big picture and figure out how things are connected before you get mired in the minutia. Like, like I often, when I learned to program, I made a ton of mistakes. One of the biggest mistakes I made was like not choosing a stack and sticking with it. Like the grass was always greener on the other side. So I jumped to some new tool or, and then you're basically, you can absolutely spend a thousand hours learning a hundred hours worth of stuff 10 times if you're not careful. So I would definitely try to back out and then I would make conscientious decisions to constrain your learning. And I would actually make sure you get all the way through them and don't let yourself throw caution to the wind and like start over. For me, I always, I called it when I was learning to code particularly in this, like it was a four stack overflow when I was trying to do it and it was books. And I would always call it the chapter four problem. I would get to like chapter four in a C plus book and stop and then move on to some other language and get to chapter four. You know, I knew what strings and arrays and variables were pretty well, but like when it started getting into, you know, now do this at the exercise portion of chapter four, I'd be like, this is not for me. I need to move on and try something different. And I think that's true for a lot of things because your brain just gets so overwhelmed with new vocabulary and new, you know, just so much. One of my favorite books is badass by Kathy Sierra. And she talks about in this, this idea that you're learning at a higher resolution as you gain expertise. So you start at that 35,000 foot view and what you're actually doing is like increasing your resolution as you spiral in on a topic where it's like, here's the whole thing. And then you're going to get down to, you know, like, like a very fine grained look and you start getting into the details of it. I still, I love that way of thinking, but the spiral approach to learning is, is, is really fascinating to me. Awesome. Yeah. I'll check out that book. I was able to pull it up on Google books and just read it. It's one of my favorites. We've at egghead, we sent every instructor that comes on board and makes a course gets, we send them equipment and that's part of the gearbox that we send as a copy of that book. So I've sent out hundreds of copies of it. I love it. And it's one of my favorite, like instructional design texts that's ever been produced. Awesome. So you're sitting down and free code camp doesn't exist. What made you decide to build a platform for folks to learn how to code? Yeah, so I was working as a school director and then I'll spare you like the long backstory, but basically I just needed to figure out how to make it so my teachers could spend more time with students and less time on their computers filling out, you know, grade reports and compliance documents and stuff like that. So I just needed to learn some basic automation stuff and keep in mind, I was a 30 year old dude in a suit, like in an office trying to, to get things done on like an old crappy windows box from Dell, you know, like the kind that like every corporation just, well, took a thousand of them. That was like the, and I didn't know very much about technology at all. I just merely consumed technology. I didn't produce technology and I didn't think I was smart enough to produce technology, but I went down, I just started Googling stuff and gradually my confidence built and I was like, Oh, I can do this. I can do this. And that's when I realized like, Oh wow. Like I needed to solve these very specific problems and I am, you know, solving them, learning these tools and they're getting done and like everybody's happy at the school and things are getting done. Like how many people are there around the world that could probably benefit from learning how to solve these problems using technology? Like this was right around the time that like AWS was really becoming like widely known, like, Hey, I could just spin up a server in the cloud and it can just do this service and I can pay 20 or 50 bucks a month to keep it running and, you know, I can go about my way with this tool that I can hit or maybe people will pay to access it and, and at the same time, this was like, like the API economy was growing, this was around 2011, I think. And I was just like, wow. Like if I could just teach people how to use this, we could dramatically increase people's free time. We could dramatically increase people's confidence with technology. So very early on in the process, I decided like, I left my job and just studied full time for about nine months and then I got a job as a software engineer and that's when like I really started learning when I was on the job. So I was like, we should just create a path that gets people to their first job as quickly as possible. And that was the genesis of Free Code Camp and the intention of Free Code Camp. And I'd argue that we've delivered on that vision to some extent in the sense that tens of thousands of people have gone through and have been able to get their first developer job and are now learning on the job, really doing the hard learning when, you know, they've got a boss and they've got colleagues and they've got accountability and all that. What's the, like you've, you've, you're tens of thousands of people. It's more than that. I would probably say hundreds of thousands of people have come through Free Code Camp and you know, like you'll get various levels of success, but what, what kind of patterns have you noticed that learners are coming to Free Code Camp and what difference are they trying to make in their lives that brings them to Free Code Camp in the first place? Yeah, most people just want to provide for their families. The median user is like maybe 30 years old. Maybe they've been working in accounting. Maybe they've been driving a bus or we have a lot of people in the community who are just like in retail. Like they went to college for a while, something happened. They got sick. Their family member got sick. Any number of things, they weren't able to finish that degree. They've just been servicing their student debt and trying to get through or get, like, there's always been the expectation that this is not where their life is going. This is not where their life ends, that they're going to do something else. What is that thing? They're not clear, you know? And then when you tell them, they hear like, Hey, you can get a pretty good job and you can have a high quality of life, you can have pretty interesting creative work if you can learn how to program and, you know, start writing or maintaining software. So that I think is the, that's like a typical person that would come to Free Code Camp is somebody who has not necessarily made up their mind that they want to be a developer, but like, let's give this a shot. Yeah. One of my, like I, the, one of the main reasons I send people to Free Code Camp, cause I love it as a service is like, you want to make a change, but how are you going to like even figure out if you like this thing or something that you're interested in doing? Cause it's not for everybody. I don't think programming computers is for everybody, but if you want to like know and understand that Free Code Camp is such a great place to start and just see and get your, you know, like dip into it and then, you know, expand into the community and there's all sorts of good avenues and I'd be wondering, you know, like specifically how is Free Code Camp helping people achieve that difference and, you know, like what is the platform itself doing to facilitate? Yeah. So we have the, you know, the core curriculum, which is what we steer people toward if they're new to software development and just looking for a sane place to start, you know, it's an ocean and, you know, you can try to drink that ocean or you can select pockets of water to drink, you know, you don't have to drink the whole thing, like nobody, like if you do a job search, like on Indy.com or LinkedIn or wherever, you're going to see like all these technologies that people think you're supposed to know and stuff. And you probably only need to know like a few key things. Like I tell people, they probably just need to know JavaScript and Python and SQL and Linux and Git, and, you know, maybe some engineering math, you know, data structures, algorithms, things like that, and some HTML and CSS. And if they know those things, they can probably do like 70% of the Java things out there or in, or at the very least they'll have the conceptual framework upon which they can just, if you know one high level scripting language, you can probably go learn the other ones. If you know a high level scripting language, you can probably go down a few layers of abstraction and learn something like Java or C plus or Rust. So one of the things that I'm wondering is related to that. How do you make curriculum decisions when you're deciding what to teach? What, what's the process for deciding what's next or, or what, what you're actually going to demonstrate and educate people on? Yeah. A lot of the decision making is around what are people hiring for? because again, like the people who use Free Code Camp, a lot of them may have time, they're not necessarily like, like they probably have a job at Starbucks or they have a job at like DoorDash or something, and they're just, they're able to carve out some time and just learn a little bit by little over the course of nine months or 16 months or something like that, and so what we try to do is make things really granular and make sure we're only teaching things that really need to be taught, but at the same time that we aren't skipping over things, the best place in my opinion to start is just teaching people HTML and CSS because there's a tight feedback loop. Like you change something in HTML and like the DOM immediately gets updated in the little preview window and you're like, Oh, okay, I get, my brain is making the connection that this causes this. If you try to teach people, for example, like Java or something where they have to like type in the code and then they had to compile the code and then run the code and then there's like some sort of output and they had to figure out, okay, like they had to put it in like, you know, debug statements and stuff like that to be able to figure out what's actually going on in the code. But if you start people with HTML, CSS, it's, some people would say it's easy. I take issue with the idea that CSS is easy. It's pretty, it can be pretty challenging and it can get as difficult. It's got a lot of depth. That's how I like to describe it. Absolutely. Chess is easy. It's only eight pieces. How many moves are there? Like, yeah, but it takes, you know, an afternoon to learn chess. It takes a lifetime to master it. And I would argue the same thing with CSS. Maybe it takes a little more than an afternoon to learn basic CSS, but that's a good place to start. And then, you know, JavaScript similarly can be run in the browser. JavaScript is probably like, you know, Atwood's law, anything that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript. I believe that is largely true. And yes, there are some things that like, you know, Julia or Rust or some other programming language would be much better at, but JavaScript is like the good enough at pretty much any use case tool, so that's the one we start with. There are a lot of things we'd like to teach that are hard to teach interactively and hard to teach in a browser, so we, it's taken us a long time to design the curriculum. For example, it was really hard to figure out how we were going to teach Linux commands and bash and shell scripting and stuff like that. When, how do you do that in the browser? Like you would have this really slow thing. Like you might be able to find something that interprets these commands or you might be able to fake it where, oh, type this command, oh, look, it worked. Here's your file system update. But we're really just like, you know, faking it. Yeah. So we wanted to actually have a proper environment, which is why ultimately it took several years of development, but now we have a relational database course. You need to do it in a Docker instance and you do it inside of VS code and you do it step-by-step, but you actually have an entire Linux environment. You actually have, you know, a file system and a command line and all that stuff. Yeah. And it's amazing because the environment's important, I think, for learning. And then how do you immerse people in and give them that authenticity is really what it's about, right? If it's all simulated and all fake when they actually hit the real environment, then a lot of times it might be tough to translate too. Yeah. Another note on that people will experience like blank canvas effect when they get out of a linear kind of progression of tutorials or instructions and suddenly they just have a big list of tests that they have to get to pass. We intentionally confront them with that experience as early and as gently as we can, because we don't want people to get hubris and think, oh, I'm the king of the world. Like, you know, banging out, like, like a lot of people, the old curriculum, the way it was designed, like they wouldn't necessarily get to those projects until they were maybe like 50 or 60 hours into the curriculum. But with the updated curriculum within, you know, maybe like five hours or so of learning, you're actually confronted with like, we call them boss battles. Oh, nice. There's like the level. And then there's the boss battle and the boss battle. If you're familiar with video games, like Star Fox, you're on the rails, it's a rail shooter and you're like flying around and shooting things. But the camera's moving at a deliberate pace and everything's pretty scripted. Like this ship is going to come out of here and you're going to shoot it and then you're going to gather like rings and whatever. But then when you get to the boss, it opens up and you can fly anywhere and suddenly it's like, oh my gosh, like there's so much freedom. But at the same time, there's so much apprehension associated with it. Like you suddenly you've got enough rope to hang yourself if you're not careful. So we try to get people to confront that early on because we do want to check their ego. We don't want people to, because the longer you let someone persist in the delusion that, oh, I totally understand how this works, the harder the come down is going to be when they realize, oh damn, like I really have just scratched the surface. Yeah. But like they're going to crash harder, right? Like it's going to feel worse because you felt so good. Now it's going to just feel bad and it's truly hard too. And you know, it's like, like that's important to acknowledge as well. I think it's interesting because you're talking about like game design, essentially like the design of video games and not gamification in the corny sense, I think that the marketing set has used and ruined that term, but gamification and the idea that, you know, games are fun because there's some challenge and you're rewarded and you know, there's ups and downs and successes and failures and that's what makes it interesting. And I'm curious, do you have like a, an instructional design philosophy? You said you had a background as an educator, so I'm wondering, you know, does that carry over and is there a, like an overarching instructional design philosophy or framework that, that you've consistently used over the years or like now, I guess. Yeah. Game design informs a lot of our instructional design decisions. One concept in game design that I think is really helpful is time to first encounter. Right? Like how long does it take after you pick up the blaster off the ground before you're shooting a demon with it? Right. Like if that's a few seconds, that's going to really get people in the game quickly. If there's like tons of exposition and cut scenes and explanatory, you know, prose, they're going to, you know, so that has been one thing is like, when you start up pre-code camp, like, yes, we do have like a little thing like, Hey, this is going to be hard. You know, we like try to set expectations. And then very quickly within, you know, a minute or so, people have read that and then click through and then they're boom, they're in the code editor. So that's one thing. Another concept that's really useful for us is like feedback. How tight is the feedback loop in Tetris? If I try to move the piece to the right and I click the thing and it goes all the way to the right and it's bumping up against the side, it's not going to go any farther and that immediately tells me, Oh, that doesn't work. I need to figure out some other way. I need to rotate it or something like Tetris is probably the most perfect game ever created in, in, in the sense that it does what it's supposed to do. And it does it very well and it's self-explanatory and it probably couldn't be any simpler than it is. So I have to look like Tetris. Okay. Like, like, Oh, wow. I just got four lines and there's this giant, you know, I don't know, like a fanfare played or something like that. I can't remember the term, but, but like, and everything flashed, you know, like, Oh no, the pieces are getting really high. How do I get rid of these? Oh, I got four in a line. That's how you get rid of them. Like you could take somebody who never played Tetris. Like, it'd be hard to find somebody that had never played Tetris, but you could take somebody who never played it. And I bet you, if you sat down and watched within two or three minutes, they they'd figure out how it works. And they'd be progressing at least like level two or level three, maybe getting 10 or 20 lines because the game is so intuitively designed. Obviously programming is a lot harder, but if you look at a lot of contemporary video games, like if you try to play like dark souls or doom eternal, or one of these games, like you're going to be confronted with tons of different buttons and different things you can be doing at any one time. And like tons of different ways you can solve any given, you know, scenario. And I think as games become more complicated, they get closer to resembling programming. And as programming gets simpler and it's way simpler than it used to be, we're sitting on like, you know, hundreds of mattresses of abstraction, you know, between us and the P down there, it does become easier. And I am confident that at some point programming will be as simple as it is in Star Trek, where they walk up to the computer, cross-reference the location of this, you know, quasar with all the flights that have come through in the past six months, and then send it to my screen, you know, something like that. We can just speak what you're thinking and it'll appear for you. Yeah. Like super duper declarative programming. So yeah, I think that games inform the design more than anything. And yes, I am a teacher. I'm familiar with like pedagogy and all that stuff. And I've gone to many conferences and heard lots of talks and poured through academic papers, all this stuff. I mean, I am convinced that video games and game development are probably the future of education. How do you make education so fun that people find intrinsic value in continuing doing it rather than just the extrinsic value, like, Hey, learn this. Or you're going to be working in retail for the rest of your life. Right. Yeah, for sure. And I remember like when I was on a TI computers, Texas instruments coding logo when I was in third grade, which dates me a bit, but like, I just remember that, you know, it's like this fun and this experience and, and, you know, up through like Oregon trail and they've been trying to do this for years, right? Like this idea that video games can also be fun and educational. And I think that's really true. And you see it in some, like there's even interesting coding environments like scratch and other things. I think that are a good examples of, of some of the ways that this can be more fun for, for people and still meet educational goals. And I honestly think that like that idea that we can incorporate fun, like learning doesn't have to be some, somebody standing at a lectern, just spewing facts at you for one and a half hour blocks. And that's what education is. I just don't think that's it. I don't think that's how our brains really function. And it's the outmoded way of doing things that's changing. Just, you know, the internet changes it. Zoom changes it. Like the interactive learning through websites changes. It's really fascinating to me. I also think instructional design is a underrepresented skill set in like our, our kind of almost like zeitgeist in general, we don't pay teachers enough. And we don't value this idea, but teaching others is a cornerstone of the advance of our civilization in a lot of ways. Yeah. Thankfully in places like South Korea and places like Norway, they do pay teachers quite a bit more. And I think that you know, in the U S we definitely take people with PhD seriously, and hopefully that will increasingly become so, and people, you know, everybody will be bringing on, you know, consultants who actually have like a strong background in teaching and have classroom experience as well as like theoretical experience and not just classroom experience, but like experience writing a book experience, designing a course. Cause that's in some respects harder than teaching in the classroom because there's less feedback. Like you really don't know, and you don't have control. Yeah. So you sit down and you free co-camp does not exist. There's plenty of different ways you could have approached it. And why did you choose to build custom versus using something that you might be able to find online? I didn't do a lot of like MOOCs as they were called back then. Like I did a lot of courses on edX and Coursera and I read lots of books and I just found that there wasn't a lot of like, it's easy to delude yourself into thinking you understand the subject when all you're doing is consuming and not being forced to produce. So again, it went back to that feedback problem. The moment like, and in fact, I describe a lot of the first few months of me learning to code as me reading stuff and thinking, all right, I got this. Then I go to a hackathon and I went to hackathons almost every weekend. I, I took the, the Cal train up and down the coast because I was living in Santa Barbara at the time and I'd like rail up to like San Francisco or rail down to Santa Barbara or I'd drive over to, to like Las Vegas and I do hackathons every weekend and that was great because there was feedback, like the, what is the remedy for optimism is feedback, like, like, or the remedy for hubris. I can't remember the expression, but basically left to your own devices. Most people will come to think like, you know, I am God in this realm. If they keep like taking stuff in, but they never have their proverbial, you know, if they never get punched in the face, as they might say, right? Like my reality is like kicking you while you're down and you're like, oh my gosh, I'm not as strong as I thought I was. Right. I think people like, like I genuinely thought, oh, I'm, I'm a developer now. Like, look at all these books I've read. And so for me, I was like, I don't want people to go around diluted thinking that, you know, Free Code Camp, because they read a bunch of articles on Free Code Camp, that they're going to be great developers and then go into an interview and get shot down. Like right from the beginning, I need to make sure people understand how hard this is and how frustrating and how ambiguous it is and you know, like, yes, a lot of people are going to see that and nope out of it, but a lot of people are going to be like, okay, like having calibrated my expectations, I now know that it's, especially when everywhere you turned, at least at the time, learned to code in three weeks, you know, like there's like this company called One Month and it's like One Month Ruby, learn all of Ruby in one month. And like, they were like serious. They seriously thought they could teach people Ruby like enough to be a developer, or at least that's what they told people and some people might have believed that, but yeah, it's not an easy task. It's very hard to learn to program. Anybody who tells you programming is easy is not doing you any favors. So immediately I was like, we need to have tight feedback loop. We need for people to be punched in the face by reality repeatedly. I'm sorry. I can't think of like a, like a more gentle, like I'm aware that there's a lot of violence and metaphors, like bullet points and things like that. Right. I'm trying to use garden analogies. Like maybe, maybe they haven't had their crops, you know, withered. Dipped in the cold water of reality. Yeah, exactly.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"There's whatever it is, like it's a shock to your system, right? Like when you, your expectations meet reality and if they don't aren't aligned, you get a system shock and all of a sudden, um, you know, like, like you got to rethink and reevaluate your course of action and your previous conceptions of, of what reality is and kind of get pushed off the mountain top a little bit and start your climb again. Yeah. Yeah. So that was like, we needed to be interactive. We need it to be hard and it started off a lot harder than it is now. And now we've got like these really gentle error, like, like hints instead of just failing test messages and error messages and stuff to try to cheer people back on, but that was one of the things it was like, just. Yeah, it was too in university course, universities are like this too. You can think that, you know, everything until you walk into that midterm and bomb and then like, okay, like halfway through the course, you get the feedback that you don't understand the material. Now you've got the remaining half to try to figure everything out before the final, and you won't actually know if you know it until you've taken the final. It's such course evaluation criteria that it really leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. So, you know, we have computers that can, you know, run code within a few, uh, milliseconds and then give you the feedback. Why not use them? And when you're building free code chem, you talked about this a little bit, particularly in the, you know, your database and relational databases course, where it was really hard to provide that environment for them. And that was a technical hurdle. But in the early days, what were the, like the largest technical hurdles that you faced when you were building the platform? Yeah, I would say the hardest, almost all the hard things we're just trying to figure out ways to teach things, interact, especially if it's a conceptual thing, like how, if you normally you would like condense a lecture down into like a single series of problems, but like, how do you teach on like, how do you get people coding? Or like a lot of times there's a copy paste this command. Great. Now, you know how to make a rest. Can we like, like how do you do that in a way where you're not completely holding their hand? Where they actually have to perform the task instead of, of just consuming it or, or clipping it from one place and moving it to another, which isn't going to help them very much. Like it's such a, uh, easy thing to just say, Oh, here's a multiple choice question. Did you understand the question? You know, things where, and I, it is hard. And we use multiple choice questions in our Python curriculum, but yeah, it's. A lot of free code games curriculum. I'm still not particularly proud of, just because I know that we can absolutely do better and it's just a whole lot of work to actually execute. You know, you know, that whole saying, what was it? It was like, uh, Noah, Ira Glass, I think is his name. He had this saying like, like, the worst thing is when you're just starting out, you have taste because you consume good instructional design or you've played a good video game. Right? Like, you know what a good video game is and you know what you're producing is not a good video game, but just knowing that what you've produced is not good, but that it's like the first step to actually creating something that is good. You have to start with taste. And as an instructional designer, you have to know, okay, this is like, I'm not proud of this or like people are never going to get this, or this is going to be frustrating for a learner. You have to know that you're doing your best, but it's going to take many iterations to get to something that's as seamless as, you know, Star Trek where Captain Picard is, you know, talking to the computer, the iteration and the idea that it's something, you know, like otherwise this wouldn't exist. Right? Like if you do not iterate and you do not put something out into the world at all, then it doesn't exist. And how do you make anything good? And the only, like the only answer to me, it's like, how do you get good at any skill is through practice. And that includes producing courses and curriculum, right? Like you're teaching people to get good at skills, but you also need to gain and skills and gain that higher resolution on the, you know, very real and tangible skills you are learning as a platform builder, educator, curriculum designer, you know, interactive courseware producer, right? Like those are all skills that you and your team need to, to skill up on. And just in the same way that the people that you're sharing knowledge with need to skill up on, on some of the core stuff so that eventually they could look at these higher level problems like you're doing now, right? Like you have to get past HTML and CSS as, as skills before you can, you know, like code your educational platform for the most part, right? That's just kind of the nature of learning. And I really think that's interesting to me is that, that, you know, you'll put it out there, even though, you know, it's going to be a little bit frustrating and it's not polished and it's not, you know, it's like, this doesn't taste good. What do we need to do next? I think that's a really healthy approach. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, pardon me for talking about myself rather than talking about instructional design, but like with my journey into music, I knew that I needed feedback and I need, I needed to like, is this good? Is this going to work? You know, and you can think that you've got like the best music in the world. You have to put it out there and actually get feedback. And it's the same thing with instructional design. So like, like, you know, I started putting my tracks out there and then people would be like, Oh, you know, this sounds janky, you know, like you get all kinds of feedback and that helps guide you in the path because as immaculate as the vision in your head may be for where you need to go, there are all kinds of hidden realities that, that your platonic solid of an idea, you know, it's not going to be a platonic solid, it's going to be a crazy lumpy ball, but it will ultimately serve the purpose because it will have incorporated all this feedback. And at the same time, there's a balance that gets straight because if you incorporate too much feedback, then it mitigates your original vision to the extent that it's just like, you know, trying to be everything for everybody. So those are other, you know, yes, this one person had trouble with this specific challenge, but that does not mean that the challenge is bad. We have to step back and take like, you know, several million people have done this coding challenge. So it couldn't be broken. Like it, maybe it's just misleading. And so every piece of feedback, you have to know when the feedback is representative and, or when, okay, if we actually wanted to address this specific piece of feedback, it would involve doing all this additional work and what it like, and when to be technically correct, or just to, just to clutch things a little bit for the sake of not having to go on a massive say, you know, side mission to explain how to do something right. Yeah. Does, and just listening to that, and I think this is interesting too, the fact that it's free. Code camp, I think in some ways probably helps and allows you to iterate because you know, like I build a commercial course and if I'm charging you for that course, if you have to pay for it, there's like this expectation of quality, but when you can fall back to like, look, it's free and we're working on it and it's going to be better if that has to remove at least some of the pressure from the overall process, I would think. Yeah. Like on the form for everybody who's like, Oh man, what the hell is wrong with this curriculum? It sucks. They'll be like, beggars can't be choosers or PR is accepted. Yeah, yeah, exactly. We can, we're open source. It was like opening GitHub issue. And often I do, I don't do that as a snarky way of like dismissing somebody's complaints. I legitimately mean it. If I say like, Hey, could you open a GitHub issue or, or maybe would you be interested in helping create a PR to fix this? These are not like me trying to offload stuff. Like I genuinely want to get people involved in the open source contribution process, but you're absolutely right. The fact that it's free code camp, like we've never had somebody request a refund. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. I can't say the same. So like, like I see the advantages and you know, it's like, there's, we could do a whole podcast episode, I think on the economics of free code camp and versus the commercial nature of it, but I think that's a pretty cool from a design perspective, cause you can get things out there, get feedback, iterate and build something truly nice over time without kind of the pressures of, you know, servicing paying customers, which always throws a dynamic into it. Yeah. That's one thing I've learned is like, you're going to have a lot of different customers who have a lot of different use cases and you know, you don't want to. Upset them. So that's how like a code base becomes a giant legacy code base. And free code game, to be fair, like one, I look at like free code campus is a game of go and not a game of chess. Like you're not taking pieces off the board. You're putting pieces on the board. Once you put a piece on the board, the entire game is going to ripple out from there, right? Like if we create a certification, we cannot remove that certification. There are people who have that certification on their LinkedIn. There are people who have that certification on their CV. We need to continue to maintain that as a legacy certification. Yeah. Backward compatibility. It's very important. And yes, a very small minority of people who use free code camp actually donate to free code camp to give you an idea. We have about maybe like 800,000 visitors a day and you know, like about 7,500 people each month donate to free code camp. So if you do the math, it's like less than 1% of people actually support free cocaine, but we don't want that to be like, like, like we want to treat with everyone's respect, regardless of whether they are helping support the project. Yeah. Like we take all grievances very seriously. That's great. Quincy, I really appreciate it. I really appreciate what you do. I see the difference that your project has made in people's lives because I'm steeped in that community generally, and I've watched people and the difference that your platform and your curriculum has made in people's lives. And just thank you. I think folks, if you're considering it or you use free code camp, you maybe want to get in on some of that sub 1% action and throw a few bucks, maybe a recurring donation to the project because it's fabulous. Anything, anything else you'd like to, anything y'all have going on or anything at free code camp, you'd like people to know about? Yeah. Thank you very much Joel for that. For like, if you're interested in getting involved as a contributor, we welcome it. But like for the purpose of like people who are listening to the show that are interested in creating instructional design, take a look at our updated responsive web design certification that we just, it's technically in beta. I don't know when this is published, if it'll still be in beta, but we spent like three years designing that and I could talk for like an hour about all the design decisions that went into that, but it's extremely granular and we do things like we show people exactly what they're going to build right at the beginning. It's no mystery as they do line by line, like build up this project, get test to pass that they're working towards something cool. And also we try to keep each step like 30 seconds to 120 seconds in terms of like, keep that manic pacing. Like if you're not running tests, like every 30 seconds, there's something wrong with the way we designed that step. I'm just making it really granular, having a tight feedback loop, keeping people like rocketing forward through the curriculum, that's our vision for that. And then at the other side is the relational databases certification, which currently you still have to pull down the Docker image and run locally. But that represents like how we're going to be doing this for the backend. So we're doing the three front end certifications, the four backend certifications, then we got the data science, it's all in Jupyter notebook where you're currently using Google Collaboratory for that, but those are like the three sections of the curriculum. And you can take a look at all those and get a feel for like what we've learned. And if anybody has any specific, like if you're a teacher or if you want some feedback on your instructional design, like definitely send me a DM on Twitter and I'll take a look and I'll give you some feedback, but the, what passes for instruction in this world, like, you know, professors standing at the front of a room, lecturing, you know, textbooks, things like that, like, like we can do better and we're going to do better. And, and, you know, I don't think any of this is beyond what typical developers or teachers could do. Like the tools are out there, they're democratized. Free Code Camp was not particularly expensive to build in the grand scheme of things, we're a 501c3 nonprofit and we've been able to do it, like I spent about $150,000 of my savings bootstrapping the organization as a nonprofit and getting tax exempt status, and, I think that if you're coming with even a modest budget, if you're at an organization, you want to update your onboarding or something like that, if you can marshal any resource, also Free Code Camp is open source, it's BSC3 licensed. You can fork it and you can put your own content into it, or you can repurpose our content, which is all, all this stuff in the curriculum is creative commons 4.0 BYSA. So yeah, I'm sorry. Like that, you were like trying to wind down the podcast. That's awesome. No, that's really cool. Like, I, I think that's that, yeah. Like, thank you for, for sharing all that because that's great information and what a resource, what a, honestly, like what a treasure on the internet, I appreciate that Quincy. Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity to be on your podcast.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So, you built something cool and I really appreciate what you've done and I think there's a lot of interesting crossover between what we've done at Egghead and what UI.dev stands for and I feel like we have some similar goals but we've taken radically different approaches so that's pretty exciting to me. I am interested also in you personally, when you approach something new and complex, maybe a subject that you haven't delved into or a new domain, what's your learning approach, your personal learning style when you do research? What I love to do, and I've given this advice, I don't know if it's great advice or terrible advice, but usually what I do is Google for whatever the thing is, I think as a developer you get pretty good at Googling. Click on every link in the first two pages and just read everything, whether it's great or terrible. And then I think, at least in my perspective, what usually happens is you start forming this mental map of knowledge in your head. And then from there, you can kind of start seeing what's good, what's bad content. And then what's always helped me, and I think naturally is what I do for a living now, is if you approach it from the perspective, whether this is true or not, that you have to teach the thing, then I think that really helps because you're kind of forced to solidify those mental models of the thing you're teaching and really approach it from a first principles perspective. So that's what I do, is I don't care who wrote it, I don't care who created the thing, I'll read everything I can about it with the understanding that whether it's real or not, that I have to teach this thing. Do you approach it from a, you're just reading webpages or are you capturing those webpages somehow? I'm not doing anything. I'm the most least fancy. In fact, when I hear people like you and the Rome cult people doing all this crazy stuff, I can appreciate it, but yeah, no, I'm just, I usually have, for those watching or not watching, I have a pen and pad and I just write down notes. Old school paper. Exactly. Exactly. And it works for me. I think I definitely need to like modernize, but as you know, there's like so much friction in doing that. Oh, come on. I just clicked the Instapaper link, highlighted Instapaper, export to ReadWise, which brings it into Evernote, which I can then cut and paste into Rome. There's nothing complex about that at all, it's totally normal. You could be like James Long and have your front end is now grabbing it using a remix from Rome. I'm not going to get into like my conversations with James, but I'm so into what he's doing and he's giving me a little peek about how he's doing it and it's like the most exciting thing that I can even think about for six hours and everybody listening in the future would just be like, Oh my Lord, please. I believe it. I'm the exact opposite, complete opposite. James very smart. That puts me at the bell curve meme, you know, he's on the far right. I'm equally as good on the far left. We'll call it a day. Yeah, I mean, I love seeing an expert like that and knowing like this isn't, I'm not going to get there, right? I don't really even aspire to conjure up solutions in James Long, who does just all this really amazing work that I'm like, what is going on? I don't even understand that, but I'm so fascinated by people that do like the inventors, right? Like I'm not really an inventor. I've always described myself as a gluer and I can take several good ideas, glue them together and present it in a way that other people can understand, almost like translation. And that's worked for me as a consultant and it's worked for me in business, but like I love just the inventors and what they're doing. It's really, it's always inspiring and I love to just dig in and kind of snoop around and like for me and code stuff, it's like all the code, like I want to get in and I love reading source. Right. That's where I joined. Do you take courses? Are you a course taker? Ironically, I don't think so. Do you like video courses? It's so hard to really know. I think I like reading more. The multimodal, right? Like when I can watch a little something, if I feel like it or consume text. And I think it's contextual based, maybe, I'm maybe just making this up, but it feels like it may be in my preference, like more contextual based on what I'm learning. I can't define those lines right now. It's got to be like per topic. Yeah. Like woodworking, I really love watching videos as an example, but for coding, it's not my favorite though. If I have like a 2x, like I can put it on 2x speed and just like really jam through it, then I enjoy it a lot more. Maybe it depends on, cause I really love like a well-produced, like a high level, Hey, here's kind of the problem this thing's aiming to solve. Like those I love. It's the, okay, let's implement this like API and like it with video, it gets a little bit like hairy, as you know, maybe those, if we're in the weeds, I love text. If we're more high level than a well, well curated videos, probably. What would you say just basically makes a good course, regardless of medium or domain even what, what goes into creating a good course? So for us, what we've always tried to do is like really approach it from like first principles. Again, I'm going to say that a lot, cause that's tends to be my buzzword, but I always try to think of it as okay. When the student is done with this like course and we could even get into what that means. Cause I think that definition is all over the place. It's just been beaten into almost meaninglessness. It's like, it's like declarative, right? Oh, that's declarative. It's like, is it really declarative? Or we're just like using that to mean like good, you know? No, I mean literally. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so for us, what we try to do is like really make it so it feels very linear and very well thought out. And for example, the example I always use is if at ever any moment where we have to go, okay, we'll come back to this later. Usually that I think of it, a course smell to, to, to use the play on words, right, exactly. If we could have spent more time on the outlining phase, maybe we could have gotten rid of that like weird kind of knowledge dependency, if you will. Right. So that's what we, that's what we spend a lot of time on is when we make our courses to make them feel very much like you're like walking up a staircase rather than rock climbing or use another like bad analogy. Right. So just having the flow of the course feel well to almost sort of when the student gets to the end of it, they're like, Oh, that almost felt like almost a little bit too easy because of the way the material was presented. And then it all layered on top of itself, if that makes sense. Yeah. The sequence of events was such that you never, there's always a little bit of struggle almost. And to me, and I've seen this comparison quite a bit like game design, right? Like where you intro it and you want it to be a little hard or it's boring, but just not hard enough to where you can't accomplish it and then you kind of ratchet up to a boss fight. Exactly. And I think the best educators are the ones who understand that and they really like embrace that. And that's what we try to do. Sometimes we don't, but like, that's always the goal is to make it, uh, have that vibe, if you will. Yeah. I think there's a lot of interesting things that you've done with your platform and how you present things. And I want to get into that. But first I was curious because you've kind of had a progression over the years where you've gone from kind of, you know, you've been an educator for a long time, right? Like you've been teaching people to code for years. What has been your progression through kind of platforms and technology and delivery and the way you've approached that? Right. So first started way back in the day, teaching in person at Dead Mountain. This was 2014. That's when I met John. Yeah. I remember that. That's when we first met too, I think. Yeah. And really got my, and I always go to Egghead to this, really got my online teaching chops at Egghead, right? Cause there is some similarities obviously when you're teaching in person and online, but it is completely different. Right? For sure. I was taught at Egghead for a bit, pivoted to do, start doing my own thing. This was like 2015-ish. Uh, ironically at the time it was still React. And then one thing led to another, had some fun with the React router guys for a little bit. Came back to do my own stuff. Uh, and now, now doing it with UI.dev. There's a lot of, we can obviously get into the weeds of a lot of that stuff specifically about platforms and all of those things, depending on which direction you want to take it. But that's the idea is you have been doing this since 2014, I think now across a variety of different mediums, different lengths. Now we're here. Just based on my observation and you went, you know, like the Egghead was that we're a platform and that's what we do. And we have a specific format that constrains you to, you know, like what we want to do. And our, our thing is kind of training trainers is a little bit of what we do and we've made a marketplace, which is certainly one way to approach thing and definitely not the other. And then you went to teachable, so you, they're kind of constraints. And then finally you've got to the point where you have constructed something that's bespoke to your needs and the needs of your learners and the audience that you serve. Why not just use an existing platform? Like why do something bespoke or would you recommend that? Or is the progression kind of, kind of important in terms of building what you've built? I think the, so ironically, whenever, like whenever someone asks you these kinds of questions, you usually just give the advice that you did. Right. So this is what I'm going to, this is what I'm going to do, but that's the asterisk on this. But so back in the day, really what I was optimizing for, and this was 2015 and I think the, I think it's still true with a few caveats, but like I was optimizing for making money and I don't think that's bad. I think that's, I mean, that's the point of a business, right? And so at the time it was okay, I could build my own platform thing or I could use a preexisting platform optimized for getting the first dollar and then figure out the platform later on if I needed to. And so that's, that's what I did and that worked out really well. We were on Teachable for, I don't know, four, three, four years. It was great in a lot of ways. It was miserable in a lot of ways, but what it allows us to do is like not worry about that and just worry purely about creating content and teaching. And that's what we did. It got to the point though, where obviously when you're playing in someone else's playground, like they make the rules and there was a lot of stuff we wanted to do, whether it was like MDX-y kind of like animation-y stuff, presentation stuff, like whenever you're with a platform, especially like Teachable, like they're not, pretty much for the three or four years that we were using it, it was like we were kind of hacking the platform to make it do what we wanted. Eventually it got big enough and had the resources where we could just roll our own thing. And that's eventually what we did. But I will say if you're just wanting to like optimize for selling something, probably the slowest approach to do it is like building your own platform. You may learn a lot. There's a lot of trade-offs there, right? You may learn a lot, you have full control, but if you're treating it like a business, you probably want to optimize for revenue first. If you're treating it as something different, which a lot of people may be, then like, yeah, you could roll your own thing. It's funny because when Egghead came about, Teachable didn't exist. And I did a Rails tutorial over like the course of two weeks and got from, it was Rails and Stripe integration. And that was, that was how it came to be, right? Like I didn't really have the option or didn't think of it at the time. And boy, it's, it's been a lot, right? Just because we still live with those same, it is evident in our entire platform that the core of it was built over two weeks in a, from a tutorial, kind of like JavaScript, right? Like the story of JavaScript. It's created over a couple of weeks and well, it shows still, it still shows. And that kind of thing is really interesting to me. Was it a struggle for you, like as a web developer to work in that environment over knowing that you could have full control if you just wanted to seize it or are you more practical than that? It wasn't because we were making money. That was the thing. Bootstrapping, you're thinking business over developer. We're thinking, thinking business, especially when I went full time on it. Like I, I had to put on the entrepreneur hat, not the developer hat. And I was able to like resist that urge for whatever, four or five years. Eventually it caught up to me. I respect that. But that's the reality, right? Is yeah, exactly. Like we needed to make money and that was the primary objective and building our own platform would have been fun and great. We would have learned a lot, had full control, but it like, who knows if we'd, I don't even know if we'd be having this conversation if I did that because who knows what would have happened if I would have spent six months building the platform before I like started selling anything. But you know, we're stuck on this one verse in the multiverse, but like on another timeline, you might've built something that'd be worse. And like that experience that you've gone through different platforms and learning what you've learned probably affected what you ultimately built when you did build something bespoke. I would assume. Right. I had, yeah. When we decided to do our own platform, I had a list of, I don't know how long, okay, so we wanted to do different than Teachable does. Because again, Teachable's built their, their platform. They have to build for the least common denominator, right? Where when we're building our own thing, we can build it however we want in the format that we like. Yeah. For better and worse, right? Yeah. And yours is like, like genuinely better, but I'm just saying, you know, we can do that. And sometimes when you do that, you might end up with, you know, functionally worse than what you could have just got off the rack. Even like around the edges, right? Because no one wants to do authentication flow, password resets, billing, right? All of those things. Full support, like all the accounting aspects of what you're doing. That actually, I was wondering, like, was there anything surprisingly challenging or were any aspects of that, like especially difficult or kind of jump up at you and you're like, oh, I didn't even think of that when you set up to build the platform? I guess it wasn't surprising because I kind of knew it going into it, but like authentication with, the way we authenticate, you know, the fancy websites nowadays is just pretty miserable. Specifically like with Next, right? If we're like SSGing everything, how do you like, you can't ship everything to the user because then like they're smart developers and they can go like, you can't have a client side thing there. Right? So like you have to do a server thing, put your SSGing stuff. So that's been our biggest struggle is like figuring out the eventual answer was to use like Cloudflare workers, you know, get the request and redirect from there. But that's been our biggest pain with the new platform is again, yeah, just all that like authentication-y, like the MDX stuff is fun. Like all of that stuff is really, we're building things like animation-y stuff is fun. Design stuff's fun, but it's like the edges. Okay. What happens when this weird use case happens or like someone wants to re-subscribe, like that's boring. No one wants to re-subscribe logic. It's always something. It really does. It branches. And then the users and the people subscribing are going to come up with, you know, all sorts of different ways that, and it's just meeting their needs. And when you're, you know, and then you have to build it basically. And we've always taken like maybe a little bit of a just-in-time approach and ignored some things that we knew we're eventually going to have to do just because, you know, it was a. I was just going to say what's interesting too is I've spoken with market front of masters. I don't know if it's still like this, but like a year and a half ago when I spoke to him, they're like, Hey, we rolled everything. We have servers in the back. Like we roll everything ourselves. I think it's just a huge trade-off. And the thesis, like the mental model we've always had is like, we're like educators. And if having a platform, exactly, if having a platform allows us to do that better than it does, but it can't come at the compromise of, okay, we don't ship content for a year. And that's kind of, we started this last year. Like we started kind of getting into that space of, okay, are we building a platform or are we like educating people? And it's so hard because once you do start rolling your own platform, naturally bugs come up, like all of those things, which takes away from like the core, you know, ethos of the business, which is like educating people. How do you balance that? This idea of, you know, like you're, it's a multi-sided marketplace in some ways, and you're building a platform and that's for you and your team. So really like your platform, your customers of your platform, and that's the same way that the learners are. How do you balance that between the creation of content and learning materials and all that? I don't, I'm still trying to figure it out, to be honest, because if you look at like our historically, like our content output, the last, like in the last few years is a good example where, and you can see it too in the numbers where we're very focused on producing high quality content. Things are going well. We shift into talking about producing high quality content as we work on the platform and then numbers start to like decline, right? Yeah. We've felt that also. Yeah. And it's such a trap. Let's stop talking about building a business and like just build the business. Right. And that's really the trap we fell out enough. Everybody does. It sounds like you guys did as well, but that's the trap we fell into the last year and a half is like getting off of teachable. Okay. Well, there's like these primitives. Now we've got to put in place with the platform and we're like pure developer mode now. Meanwhile, like we're not putting out content, we're not doing the things that like got us to where we were. And this really, this last six months has been trying to reset that, right? And go back to like our roots of, okay. It's really like the bell curve meme personified, unfortunately, but just getting stuck in the middle land, right? Oh, we should be A-B testing and we should be doing like meetings to talk about meeting sequences. Oh my gosh. It's the worst. And it's such a trap. Yeah, exactly. It's such a trap. And that's why now it's like, let's just get back to making great content. And that's really been the focus of, yeah, this last six months and so it's going well. Yeah. It's really difficult though. And it's always hard to balance. And there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of examples to look at. There's a lot of people talking about best practices and there's a lot of, you know, fluff on the internet and it's what's really important and what's the core of this business and is the core of our business, the platform or what is it? And one of the most interesting things I think about your, you know, like what you've built is you have a very limited set of courses, you know, you go to all these other places and we're all producing, you know, like here are 32 dozen courses choose your, you know, choose wisely where you have this like small set of courses and you know, it's not, it's not diminutive, but it's, you know, like it's just limited and focused, which I think that's really interesting actually. And probably a challenge, but also, I mean, I fundamentally feel it's probably a good thing in terms of, you know, your niche and focus and creating quality. And I was wondering, is that a conscious decision to have that kind of more limited, high quality focused catalog or how did that come out? It's definitely conscious. What we've always tried to do, cause again, like it's kind of core of the business, right? We're small, we're bootstrapped and to win in that with those constraints, you just have to be hyper-focused and it's kind of related to what we just talked about. Right. And I think that's one thing we didn't mess up on. We don't really care if we have an Angular course or like a view course, that's not who we are. We're not going to pretend we're Angular developers because we're not, we know nothing about Angular, but we know a lot about React. We know a lot about TypeScript and we know a lot about JavaScript, so we're just going to triple down. And luckily for us, because we're bootstrapped, there's plenty of market in just that, right? I always look at, you look at like Udacity and I know some of the numbers cause I worked with them and they're making a lot of money just from their React content. And that market share, just React, right? Just React is plenty of pie for us by the nature of like how we've structured the business. And so I think that's one thing we have done well on is just being very focused with, okay, if we make a course, let's make it the best we can. And we don't need to have a course about everything, but there are certain things that we need to have or at least try to have the best course on, right? TypeScript, React, JavaScript, nothing really, nothing else really. One of the interesting things that you've talked about in the past is this idea that, you know, like you, you aren't building a marketplace, right? Like Udemy or Pluralsight or Frontend Masters or even Egghead is absolutely a marketplace where you are going out and recruiting instructors to, you know, in-place content that then, you know, like the question is, and I think it's an interesting one that you've solved nicely is like, how do you maintain that later? Because you know, like our problem is people make stuff and then they, getting them two years later to update it is very much a cat hurting exercise and it's just how often it just doesn't even work. And I think that decision is interesting too. And it was that, you know, like where you have full-time employees versus, you know, bringing in contractors to create content, I assume that was a conscious decision as well. Yeah, it was very conscious. The idea there, it's so tricky because it very much limits like how quickly you can do things. But basically like I sat down and I was like, I don't know, based on what I know about creating content and creating courses, I don't know, I don't have the skillset to have someone not be full-time to do it, right? You guys have pulled it off well. It's so challenging. It's so hard, right? Like your full-time job essentially for a while there was essentially that, right? And I didn't want, I really think startups are like just choosing the problems you want. I didn't want those problems. The hard part there is, cause like philosophically that's fine, right? Bring people on. If they make content, they work full-time, they get salary, all those things. The problem is someone like Kent, for example, the incentives are pretty aligned with you and Kent because Kent can make a lot of money doing it well and then you could help him do that, right? But it's very hard. And Kent, as both of us know, has grinded for a very long time in getting to where he's at. He puts in the work. Exactly. And you can't hire a developer, one, because the developer has a very unique skillset where they can go and make a lot of money somewhere else, right? And so it's tricky because if you just hired them on a, paying them whatever an average salary, they're going to work here for two months, realize it's very hard to make high quality content and then just go back to being a developer and enjoying their life, right? So you have to do this thing where you have to align incentives with them and all of these things and what that eventually ended up looking like for us, because I'm not a big fan of bonuses and all that crap, what it ended up looking like for us was like, okay, instead of raising money and giving our equity away to VCs or angel investors, I just want to make it so if you come work here and you're in that grind with me, essentially building the business. Like if there is ever like an exit or anything, you have equity that's essentially meaningful for you. And, and it feels less like, okay, you're like working at you at a dev and this is also your thing. Yeah. And it's really easy to get to the point where like you're saying that and it's just words, right? But developers are smart and they know that they need to be on the cap table and have like significant equity, right? That's the only way it's worked for us is pay them a lot of money, give them significant and then just get them like on board. And it's so far, it's worked out fairly well. So we'll see, it's still too early to tell if that's the right, but it's, it's worked out fairly well. Yeah. And I mean, you kind of, I don't know, there's the, the personality side of it. And when you get somebody in there out there and they're doing their own personal content marketing and they're, you know, building a Twitter following and there's this, there's a lift, right? Like the audience lift that you get from that, but there's also trade-offs and that now you are kind of working around their schedule and you're absolutely right. Especially if you're talking about, you know, bringing in developers where the current salad table for developers is ranges from, you know, a hundred thousand dollars at the entry level to sky's the limit. It feels like sometimes, and, and, you know, it's okay, can you pause and do this thing and you'll make a little bit of cash and you can, you can get up and, and I had people before and we did this idea of West boss as a service, cause Wes has done really well and people see that and they're like, I want to, you know, I want some of that West boss action in my life. The reality of what Wes has done is incredibly hard and not everybody can do that. I don't, you know, it's like you just don't, it's a balance thing and you have to be very focused over many years like Kent has done and you know, it's other people too, but you know, it's not just, Oh, I can do this. I can take two months out of my life and bam, I'm going to be dropping an eight figure course on the internet. It just doesn't work like that. Kind of to switch gears. How do you approach instructional design? I know this is something that you think about a lot and it's one of my favorite topics to kind of nerd down on, but when you think about instructional design, what does that mean to you and how do y'all approach it at you? So the way we do it, and again, this goes back to what we talked about earlier, like this very linear approach to me, it's all, and I get it, this is like buzzword territory and I am known to do this, so call me out if I do it, but basically like it's, it comes down to what I think about as context, right? So whenever you get an introduction to anything, like this is your first time learning about like whatever props and react, whatever the subject is, we'll give you a video introduction to that thing. We'll give you a text introduction to that thing and at that point, the assumption is you don't need to know any other context around that subject other than what was in the course previously. Yeah. Right. So at that point you're like, okay, I'm feeling pretty good. I got a video. I got some tech. I, I at a high level understand what's going on. I feel like I know the thing. Maybe I don't really know it yet because I haven't done anything with it, but I feel like I, I at least know what this thing solves, like the problem it solves, it's use case, things like that. From there, we dump them into the quiz, which is just a generic, nothing really too fancy choice kind of quiz. Yeah, exactly. From there, what we'll do is we call it like a non-contextual, I call this cause I haven't figured out a better way to phrase this, but like a non-contextual like practice, right? Where, okay, let's stick with the props example. Here's a few like code sandboxes, the here's us like creating the element with react, we're passing some props. What you need to do is you need to grab those props, essentially display them in a certain manner, right? So it's, it's a very hyper-focused way to practice the thing that you were just introduced to, right? So there's, there's no state. There's not, there's no routing. There's nothing else. It's the thing that we just talked about and there's no other context you need other than to practice it. From there. Contextually isolated to what it is we just learned from the introduction, right? Exactly. Yep. From there, there's like a solution, which is basically just me walking through the solution. You get the code sandbox and everything. And then from there, what's interesting, what we try to do, and this goes back to what we talked about earlier with, which is like, we spend so much time trying to think of like how the course flows is what we try to do after that. Cause at that point you've seen, you've got like the non-contextual introduction, the non-contextual practice. That's good. But there's another step there, which is like seeing that thing in a bigger project, right? Cause you can't just play around with these non-contextual things. Cause eventually like, that's not how it works. That's not how the world works. Right? Yeah. So you go to work on Monday and guess what? It's very contextual. And so from there we throw them into a project that we've been working on the whole time. And then it tried to implement that thing in that project. So it gets a little bit tricky.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"tricky because like not only do you have to design a course that flows in a certain way, we also have to design like a sentence, like literally get like commits structured in a certain way so that as they're learning it, they could then take that and apply it to the bigger project. And essentially it's like rinse and repeat that for the entire course. And then at the end we have just like a project that they essentially recreate, which is everything they've learned up until that point. When you're making the projects, is that, are you putting on like a web application architect hat at the same time as a learning designer hat? Exactly. Because it needs to be authentic too, right? Like this, it can't be totally contrived. It needs to be something that they might encounter is the shape of a professional problem. Usually the way it works is like I'll put on the developer, yeah, the architecture hat, I'll build the project and then I'll put on the education hat and okay, how can we essentially rip apart this project to where like, what would a normal Git commit flow look like for this project? And can we then align that and map that to our like course material? Kind of like reverse engineering, but with learning design thrown into the mix. Is that something that like, is that typically you doing that or do you compartmentalize that process to where, you know, somebody is building the example, somebody is breaking the example down or is that a collaborative or a single person? It's usually a single person, which is then goes back to the equity thing, the incentives thing, because that whole process is a very, that's a whole thing. It's a process, right? It does not just conjure itself out of thin air. It is something that requires expertise, experience, and lots of, well, lots of context, I guess. Right, right, right. And yeah, it's hard to do that. And you have to have a lot of patience and all of those things, right? And it goes back to like, okay, how do you find those people? That's also tricky, right? And then so anyway, that's how we structure it. It's had pretty good results. And that's, again, going back to building the course platform, we were able to kind of design the course platform around that idea. And so now all of our courses kind of follow that same model. You put in reps and then like you were putting in reps on the content side of it before you built the course platform. So you kind of had, this is how our content structured. This is effective for people that are using it. Therefore we can put this together in terms of, in the context of our course platform. And now we have the presentation that we were hoping we've always wanted as well. So you're kind of layering on that, iterating on an idea where at all times it feels like to me, learner outcomes and learner success is the key to literally everything. Right, exactly. And I think we were able to do that because we suffered on Teachable for so long, to be honest. Yeah. And that's pretty good. Like you're over there, this is what we don't want. We know everything we don't want and the little handful of things that we do want. And then you're also able to observe across other platforms too. And these are the patterns that we think would be great for us. And then I feel when I did Egghead and it was like Rails was my choice. And these days, you know, like between, I don't know if you use any no code visual programming tools, but, and we're programmers, so we can take a perspective on it and use like Next.js and all that fun stuff. But I'm like amazed at what is available now in terms of putting together, you know, the modular pieces that, that assemble into your Voltron platform, right? Like it's, it is a really cool landscape right now for doing that sort of thing, I think. Yeah. I'm a big, I think this idea of like developers who leverage no code or like low code, I feel like that's so underrated. Like actually moving that direction in a lot of ways, just because it's the best. Yeah. We're throwing everything at Zapier that we can, because you just get so many benefits from it and the downside's fairly limited. And yeah, that's, we're huge fans of it, especially again, going back to the ethos of, okay, we're here to make money. We're not here to like nerd out about platform stuff. I don't care. I don't want to write a node server that has like scale and I don't want to do, you know, I don't want to have a distributed server using all these, like, whatever. I just want like, let's throw it at Zapier. It obviously it has to be performant, all of those things, but that's essentially the ethos is like, we're here to build a business first. And that's kind of been core for what we've done. I mean, let's face it. Like a learning platform is not a bank, right? So we have different needs and different, you know, like transactional capabilities and just even scale issues that are way smaller than something like that. And you know, it's like learners and it needs to work right and it needs to be performant and people have expectations just based on their use of the internet. And we had developer audiences, so they're even a little more persnickety than maybe some folks would be, but it's like that problem space really lets you think about it. And I love that idea of like developer second, educator first. I think that's a, it's a kind of a force multiplier in the business and maybe a great way to think about it. I think it's good for hiring too, because it's very clear. Okay. Are you like, if they don't align with that, then it's not a culture fit for lack of a better word on both sides. Right. And if they do, then it's all great. There's probably not many other places in the world that's going to be a better fit for you than what we do. Yeah. So that's, people have resonated with that. So I was interested in this idea of contextual and non-contextual practice and is that something that you've kind of synthesized or does that come from previous experience or education or was there a book that got into this? I honestly think I made it up. I'm sure I'm not the first one to think of it cause it's not super novel, but I literally, we were trying to write copy for like our landing page one day and I was like, I don't, there's not a name for this. Like we just, I think it happened naturally. Like the example is not very good copy. Yeah, exactly. That's a, that's a great way to put it. Turns out developers don't like that. So yeah, I don't know if I'm sure I had inspiration somewhere. I don't even know. I honestly think the first time I did, or one of the first times it probably happened cause it probably happened by accident where I was like, Oh, we just did this practice and now like in the project, this is what we're doing next. And I was like, Oh my gosh, that's great. You know, that's honestly, that's probably what happened is probably all by accident. And then I just put a name to it for marketing purposes. I actually Googled contextual practice and it has something to do with the art world and around the depression. There we go. Yeah. And I was like, I don't think that's it. Like it was, this is not the thing. That's how you know. That's how you know. I just pulled that out of my book because I did not come up with that. One of the interesting things is that you've long done this and ever since you were, you've been producing your own learning content, you've had a guarantee associated with it, a guarantee that this is going to be up to date. And I think that's fantastic. And I was wondering, you know, is there a process to maintaining them or what triggers an update or how do you look at that and maintain these courses over time? It is, and it really goes down to, again, like the very methodical approach we've taken to the business. Because if you have, if you're outsourcing content, it's much harder to do that, right? Because then you have to essentially convince someone to do that, or you have to swap that out with something new, which is then you just convincing, as you know, you just committing someone else to do that. We were, because we took the approach of like, okay, only full-time people make content. We were kind of uniquely positioned to be like, okay, well, if it's our full-time job to do this, then we don't have an excuse to not keep it up to date. It's just what we do. And then from there it's, okay, well, how are we going to know if something goes out of date? And then the only answer there is be very involved in the ecosystems of the things we teach, which is why we really only teach a few different. That's where the constrained course catalog really becomes an asset to you because now you're not having to track literally the entire scope of web development. You are like, this is our section. This is the good stuff. Exactly. Just, just react, just TypeScript, just Java. And it's all, those are all the things we care about and are like passionate about anyway. So it's not really like hard to figure out when something goes out of date because we're going to naturally see it anyways, because that's kind of all we do. Yeah. Yeah. We tracked Angular through the whole move in there and just, you know, and then we ended up with this sprawling catalog where, you know, like you go through it and it's just, there is no keeping up. And then we end up having to rely kind of on learners raising flags is at one point we were able to pretty much monitor it. And then at some point it hit the tipping point where there was just too much. And now it's, we rely on that and we go back through and review when somebody raises a flag, but it's a whole, now we have a whole process around, you know, like the tending that sort of garden, which wasn't intended, right? Like I think. Again, there's a lot of benefits to that, but there's some, you just chose different problems than I chose. Yeah. It's trade-offs all the way down. Like it's trade-offs. And I have said this, I would never like knowing what I know now would not build an egghead like in the way that we have become. And I still think it's good. And we do a lot of interesting things. It's just, if I was choosing down mostly with my business hat and kind of instructional designer hat, I'd be like this, I would do this way different, you know, it's not Netflix for nerds. It's some sort of other. Right. Right. Right. You know, like whatever it might be. So I want to kind of flip into, you know, a little bit about the development of content and how you think about maybe even a little bit of the marketing side of it. And when somebody comes, when a learner comes to UI.dev, what is the difference they're trying to achieve in their lives? What's the primary driver that you've seen over the years for people trying to get through this stuff? Right. We haven't, again, going back to what we talked about earlier, like understanding a user is very important and it's good, but there are only like a few of us and we're like really heads down with content. So it's really hard for us to like, we do one-on-one onboarding calls with everybody who signs up. So that's been super helpful, but we haven't, there's not a strong pattern there, right? Like sometimes we get backend developers who get thrown into a React project and they got to learn React. Sometimes it's a bootcamp grad who they skimmed over React, but they want to get deeper into it. Those are usually the patterns. A React developer who all of a sudden they are using TypeScript at work and now they got to learn TypeScript, right? It's usually the biggest pattern is that someone usually has a pretty strong need, right? Usually it's not. They're trying to solve something right now, basically. They're trying to solve the problem, which is a great person. It's a great place to be as a business if you can essentially answer that, right? Because we're not having to prove, we're not having to educate around the problem. The problem's already clearly there and it's in everybody's best interest to solve that problem. And so that's been really nice, which is why we don't spend a ton of time thinking about that side of things, just making the best courses we can. Because by the nature of that, usually people will find us for a variety of different ways if they have a specific problem. Have you learned anything surprising or interesting from those conversations that you have with onboarding? I would assume so. But I feel like you are doing that with those calls. And I'm wondering if you've had anything that's been like, wow, we didn't even think of that or just what's the benefit of doing these calls in the first place outside of like you're helping them, but what's the business benefit that comes out of it? The business benefit is it's so surprising to people because no one really does that at this level. If you're like a whatever B2B SaaS, it probably makes sense. White glove onboarding, right? Exactly, exactly. If you're paying someone 40 bucks, which is what they're paying us, or a yearly subscription, no, it doesn't really do that because that doesn't really scale. But again, not to throw out Paul Graham, but the do things that don't scale, it's worked out fairly well for us. I mean, this is another one of those examples where because we're so small, bootstrapped, we can't afford to personally onboard people and it does work out well. And we do get to learn about the user. So to answer your question specifically, it's been interesting to see, because we have courses, we also do events, which are essentially like your verbiage earlier, like Netflix for developers in a different sense than what you guys do. And it's been interesting to watch some people, the majority of people sign up for courses, but some people are just there for the events because they're not necessarily, it's usually the more experienced developers. They don't necessarily want to take a course, but if Sunil or John from CloudFlare is coming in to talk about CloudFlare, that's really interesting to them and they want to be there. So that's been fun to watch. Other than that, it's mostly just good to understand the problems people are having. Essentially like personalize their flow through the product about how they can solve those problems. Yeah. Here's where you can start and here's, you know, like vaguely get to where you're going. Right, exactly. And that kind of avoids having to have this like, this learning path algorithm-y thing that you do if you can just do it manually. That's another advantage to the constrained catalog too, right? Like the catalog is the path. It's not like you have to carve a path through here. There's, you know, start here and end here and you're pretty much going to get the full map that we offer. It's fairly clear. Yeah. It's fairly obvious what you need to do. Have you had any like major success stories? Like anybody, like just kind of blown your mind over the years or got like feedback from users where they've gone through this and it's changed their lives in some significant way? Yeah. It's always like the, either I got a job or I got a raise. I think, and you probably see that as well, where it's funny because it feels so small because you're like, Oh yeah. Like, thanks. Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it. Right. But it's not that fundamentally pivoted their entire life. It's like this thing you did for them. And so it's, it's just fun to be in a space where that is almost kind of like a, the normal result, not maybe not normal, but that's a fairly common result of the input, right? Which is just, which I feel like we're very spoiled by because again, if you're selling like, you know, B2B SaaS stuff, like you're not really doing that at all. No, I agree with that. You just, you kind of drop in there, their B2B ocean and you're not seeing those individuals and you can help businesses. It's not that you can't, it's just, you don't see that kind of personal individual success story where you, when you're, you're teaching people like that, you really got a taste of. And even like years later too, I'll get messages now that say, or I'll do a YouTube video and the one in the comments will be like, Oh, like I took Tyler's course in 2017 and now I'm a whatever, whatever at whatever company, right? Like even, even just those small things are still just super rewarding because it, yeah, you're just able to just a little bit move people in the direction they want to go and it compounds and yeah, it's super rewarding. So, so your, your newsletter bites is great and people love it. And I see it, you know, like it's constantly like every time it's released, there's like a wave of people that just adore it. And I'm like, is this something that you're setting aside specific time? Are you like timeboxing this or what's the like development process? And I'm kind of making assumptions. Do you write it or is it a collaborative effort or how does it, how does it work? Yeah, it's definitely collaborative. So Alex Brown who works with us, he owns it and that's kind of the vibe of the whole company too is we're so small that you really just have to take a certain thing and like own that thing. Bites is his, React content's mine, Alex Anderson has the TypeScript content, stuff like that. And so the way it works is he'll spend, I don't know, three or four days a week, maybe sometimes even more, he spends usually a little bit of time like figuring out what topics are happening that week. For example, this last week was the fun one of like next verse remix. So just getting the kind of all the context of what's happening there, writing a fun little story from there and Alex Anderson helps with him that as well. But basically from there he gets at the point where he's okay. To me, this feels like it's ready to ship. At that point he gets it to me. I'll spend a few hours on. What's nice about that point is I can come in just with like jokes. He can get the meat of it. Colored coffee, I think is the term. Exactly. I can just, I could come and just, yeah, just be funny, which is fantastic because like I could just drink caffeine and be funny and luckily it works out fairly well. And then that's usually the process, right? We try not to overthink it again, going back to the just great content people love. And if we could be funny along the way, that's great too. And so that's the process. He spends, he spends a lot of time on it, gives it to me. My takeaway from that is that it is a very real and up priority in the literal sense of priority is it receives attention and it is a product that you apply a lot of effort to and think about as a company wide priority. It's up there. It's up there with a top three priority. Distributions courses is one, like distributions one and really bites is like the lead with like distribution. So it's like, it's really, if not the priority, it's, it's number two. Well, I mean, email is a great platform and if you can use it in a way that respects users and respects their inbox and gives them something actually valuable in the sea of just nonsense that we get in our inbox, if you can be a highlight, like you really stand out and there's no other platform that converts people into customers at the end of the day. Right. Right. Or even just like brand advocates. Right. Which like humor is a fantastic way to do that. Absolutely. Turns out people love it. And even, even if someone never even buys a course, what's nice about bites is like they could still at least realize on a weekly basis that we exist and that's, I mean, that's marketing, right? Like that. In a very authentic way too. Cause you're, it's like a journalism approach and kind of, you're doing a little lampooning in there as, as well, but you're, you know, it's like a, it's, it's journalism and you're out there coming up with stuff and sharing the important stories, putting a light twist on it so that it's fun to consume. And I think that's, it's really a service that you're, you're offering people and it's at no charge, but you know, it's like, it is valuable and receive that value and then reciprocate at some percentage over time. But it's, I don't think you can do that if you're just trying to like market to people through your newsletter. Definitely not. And it's been fun. It's, it's fun too, because so much has, I mean, as you've seen this conversation, like so much of the education-y, business-y side of things is so serious and it's so dense and so boring and to be able to be fun for a few hours a week, it's fantastic. And even, you know, I feel like even developers, right. We're so serious so much of the time, that I think that's why people- Trying to find flaws in everything. Exactly. As a job, right? Yeah. And I feel like that's why people love it because it's just not that. We don't take ourselves too seriously. Like we make fun of technologies and it's fine because we kind of just make fun of everything. And there's like clear limits that we don't cross, but like for the most part, it's okay to make fun of Remix and Next and like- The tech, not the people that are making it. Exactly. Because people are really working hard on all this and everybody- A hundred percent. And I think there's ways to do that. And even just like making fun of developer culture in general, I feel like people love it because for the most part, we take ourselves way too seriously. Well, Twitter is a fire hose of potential content for that newsletter, I suspect. It is. It's the best. It's the best. Yeah. Has anybody been mad if you had to have any tough conversations over an issue of bytes? The biggest thing in the early days is just because it's a bunch of dudes making it. Yeah. And it wasn't bad. Like for example, this is a good learning point for people. Our headline was, so basically what we'll do for the title, very unscientifically, is we'll take a random text from the newsletter and just have it be the title. And so there was a line in there about like Pretty Hurts, which is a Beyonce quote. And so that was the title. So then a woman messaged us and like, Hey, this isn't necessarily bad, but just the perception could be bad. Yeah. Right? Like this idea of like Pretty Hurts, whatever. We don't need to go into it. It's in a direction you don't want necessarily. Exactly. And I was like, Oh, that's fantastic. And that's not, one, it's not even a good joke. And two, she's totally right. And we didn't see it because we're, you know, a few dudes making this thing. So stuff like that's been the biggest, but yeah, we've surprisingly been able to, maybe not surprisingly, because we do have very clear lines of what we make fun of. We haven't had any real issues that I'm aware of, at least that have been brought to my attention. Other than like those little small ones. It's like, Hey, just so you know. Yeah. Well, that's just good feedback too. I mean, like, that's like, thanks for looking out at that point. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And since then we haven't had, we haven't had any other ones like that. What's the most audacious goal that you and the team have for you and Ed? We would like, so again, going back to like, which is a very ironically, maybe ironically, like philosophically different than Egghead, unless you've changed your opinion, which I don't think you have, because you wouldn't be sitting where you are. In order for us to give away equity, there needs to be an assumption that this equity is going to be worth something one day, right? Egghead, at least historically, has been very much not that. Well, our contracts are weird to where selling the business is. Like you don't want to sell. Yeah. I don't know if you're right. I don't know if you're as passionate as that today, but in the back of the day, you're like, no, we're not going to sell. We're building a business that, you know, we want to run the rest of our lives, which is very commendable. When you're giving equity to people, there's, you can't really have that stance or else it's like, okay, I don't, equity is essentially worth this, right? And so that's probably the biggest goal is like, just create a bootstrap, a company that one day we sell and everybody is happy with that sale because they have equity. What that looks like, obviously like it's, that's a whole nother conversation to have, but like that's eventually the goal is to make it. So like the people who took the chance coming here to get equity, we'll eventually reap that reward. So in retrospect, I think that is a better way to design a company from a business and like contractual and legal structure set up with this idea that we might at one point have the option to have a liquidity event versus I am going to scuttle this entire operation from the very beginning to where it would be impossible to ever sell it because that's how I feel when I'm 37 versus when I'm 47. And I don't know, I'm just saying hypothetically, like there's different ways to look at that. And you know, hindsight is always 20-20 and I'm still pretty firmly in that and like Egghead will exist, but it's like, it is definitely, there's trade-offs to both ways. Right. Right. And I think if that never happened, then I've always said too, I've always liked to just pay people a ton of money because hopefully we're making a lot of revenue. If your equity is not worth anything, then like maybe one day it will just pay you a ton of money to make content and learn things and you'll enjoy that as well. Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, dividends is a thing too, right? That is very much a thing. Ironically. Like it's, that's not bonuses. That's okay. We have liquidity and we're going to spread it across our shareholders whom, you know, if you're giving equity would be the people that are actively developing, which is not the same as some sort of major transition where Pluralsight buys UI dev and absorbs it into their catalog, which. Right. Right. Not going to happen. Yeah. Pluralsight. Yeah. But don't come looking at my door either. Tyler, it was really great to chat with you. I really appreciate the intention at which you've designed this entire operation and the business and the quality and learner outcomes. I think it's incredible and inspiring and, and Frank, frankly, like I think it's, you're just adding to the whole mix and I think it's just great. So thanks for taking the time to talk to me. Of course. It means a lot. \")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey, Scott. Hey, how's it going? I'm doing great. I'm looking forward to chatting. I really love what you built with your level up tutorial site. And I think you, you've added a really interesting piece to the conversation in our web development sphere with your podcast that you record with West boss. Before we get started though, I was curious when you sit down to learn something new and you're learning a new complex skill, what's your approach? How do you go about learning something new and difficult and challenging? Yeah. Part of my approach typically is just to get my hands dirty a lot. I'm definitely more of like a learned by doer type of person. You know, it's never really the type of person who was fully calculated before starting anything. It was more or less, you know, Hey, this thing kind of looks neat. Let me see if I could get just anything kind of working on it. Whether that isn't in code, right? If it's in, if it's in code, I'm going to maybe read the read me, but do a little bit of hacking on it first to get it something up and running, get it kind of working and then just experiment with it. And it's just in general life skills though. I'm definitely trier, you know, I'll try a whole lot of things and whether or not they're successful or not the first time doesn't necessarily mean that I have to stop trying, I guess. Are you a consumer of courses? Yeah. Yeah. I do watch a lot in mostly just because I'm not a skilled reader. I have dyslexia. I have a really bad short-term memory. I have a lot of challenges with reading. So it's like, I ended up missing a lot of things. It's really weird for me. I'll, I could read a line in a book and then have to come back. And when you go to the next line, I'll like read the same line again and not realize it. It's just challenges the way that my brain functions. So I ended up consuming a lot of audio material, a lot of video material, just in general, I retain it a lot better. When you're doing that research, what are you doing to like capture it? Because I have the same struggle. I'll go through something and it just like, it kind of disappears off into the ether. But how do you capture it? What are your kind of, I guess they call it personal knowledge management strategies these days. I use Obsidian for a lot of things to just have the whole linked notes system. But primarily what I'm doing, like while I'm learning is I have the Remarkable tablet, have you heard of this? Oh yeah, it looks like paper has a pencil look to it, right? Yeah. And it's an e-ink tablet that like the battery lasts for like two weeks. So it's always. Kindle drawing tablet is how I think of it. Exactly. Yeah. And because it's like always charged whenever you need it, I always just have it right by my desk. So I'm usually just kind of sketching out things on this all the time. Just writing quick little notes to myself, especially if it's small topics, if it's large topic, I'm, it depends on like what my learning is for. If it's learning to reproduce it into like a course setup, I'm usually firing up like a, like an outline that I have for putting together courses. And then I'm starting to take notes and do a little bit more of like a structured outline for the course, rather than like for my own brain, I suppose. But usually I'm just like kind of sketching out things. Are you a visual note taker? Like little doodles and stuff to go along with your notes. Yeah, but they're not like good doodles or doodles. They're just like, yeah, yeah, definitely. That's not a requirement. Like I personally, when I'm taking notes like that and I love, like that's why I love paper and lately good notes five on the iPad has been really great for me cause it's just super simple, but it's always like little scribbles and lines and, you know, like connecting and just a way to like process it in my brain and give that visual connection really has helped me quite a bit in terms of memory. Yeah, totally. I do like drawing emphasis on things and yeah, absolutely. What are some qualities of a good course in your mind? I think for me, it's more or less like what the user takes away out of it. And like, sometimes, you know, there, you get into this flow of like the course has to fit a project structure and it's nice to like walk away with a project, but oftentimes, you know, that can come at like a detriment to the course where you're just like kind of shoehorning things in there to. Finish or complete the project. So for me, it's like, is the user going to have enough of the core experiences that they would have when they're working day to day and like be able to potentially understand when bumps come up, what they can do to solve those bumps. It's like, it's kind of tough because you're often, you don't want to overexpose somebody to the, like the amount of things that could go wrong. You don't want to try to cover all of the bases. You're like preparing for something that's not going to happen there, right? Oh, if you do this, it could break this way. If you do this, it could break this way. The user largely doesn't care about that when they're learning something, but like being cognizant of maybe what the most important things are to either call them out or even show them is in my mind, like, you know, a big problem with courses because they do, they talk about like course fatigue where people that buy a ton of courses and don't take them or they take them and they can't get out of that flow of, okay, I did the course. Now what? Now what? Yeah. And so that's always been like a thought process in my mind is like, will the user be able to actually do the common things that you would need to like make an HTTP request, display some data, put this up on the internet somewhere. Like the common patterns that you're just always going to need to have in just about every single project, make sure that stuff's covered in a way that they're going to be comfortable doing that on their own without you. I don't think anybody wakes up on the weekend is like, I'm going to take some courses this weekend. Generally speaking, they're wanting to make some sort of difference in their lives and what, like in your experience with level up and otherwise, what is the difference that like a developer is trying to achieve in their lives when they're seeking out a course? Yeah. You know, I deal a lot in like, kind of like newer technology stuff or maybe like even just released kind of things. And oftentimes they're looking for, how do I do this thing? I already know how to do in something else again, because it's, yeah, I do a lot of beginner tutorials too, but like the most of what I'm doing is for that intermediate person who has like, at least an idea of how things generally work, or at least they have a, you know, just a prior experience there. So it's more or less like, what can we do to like, reassociate these topics with things that already exist in your brain? Most likely. How do you like keep abreast? Like, what do you know in terms of what to teach, right? Like you, you're trying to keep current and there's always this change. And particularly in technology, right? There's always something new and interesting. How do you sift through all that and decide what it is you're going to like spend your time as a teacher producing to help people get what they want out of tech? Largely, it's largely what I'm interested in. And, you know, I do listen to what our subscribers are trying to work on or what they're interested in or what technologies they feel are underrepresentative, underrepresented in content. But I, for the most part, like if I'm not excited about something, it's really hard for me to teach it. Like I'm excited about it. And if I'm not excited about it, it's really hard for me to like find those nuanced things that you would find. Because I'm going to be like just putting together code examples for, you know, for the purpose of doing a course and not for fun and to learn this thing. So, yeah, I have a little bit of a struggle with that because like I do often struggle between like, is this the course I want to do for me or the course that's going to be most useful? My wife always says I'm like three or four months too early on a course. She'll be like, you release this course four months too early. Like nobody knows what this thing is. And then like four months later, someone else will release a course at just the right time or who knows what, you know, it's like for me, it's definitely a little bit of a struggle, but definitely something that like I pick stuff that I'm interested in. I'm like recording a course right now on Svelte Cubed and like doing 3D in Svelte. And it's largely just because, well, besides the fact that, you know, we're going to have, we're all going to have to learn 3D at some point if we're doing UIs for augmented reality and who knows what in the future. But it's nice to have a little bit of an exploration there. And when I was just diving into Svelte Cubed, I had done React 3 Fiber before and I was just thinking this stuff's so cool. I mean, this is so exciting and it's really easy for me to crank out too many demos for a course because I'm really just like a kid at a playground, right? I'm just making stuff for fun, making stuff for myself, really. How do you figure out like what the examples or what the demo is going to be when you're, when you are playing around, when you're in exploration mode and you're trying to figure it out and narrow the field down to what's going to actually make the course? How do you, what's the process for coming up with good examples? Yeah, I oftentimes I'll have a bit of an outline of like the core concepts that need to be taught in something, right? Where it's like, all right, you obviously need to know updating state. You need to know this, you need to know that routing, whatever. You have these core ideas and I'll outline those. But when I'm coming up with like the project examples, they're usually, they're usually I'll come up with an example and say, Hey, I need something to show a spring, like a spring animation using 3D. Okay. Well, I have the ability to create something kind of fun here, or we made something kind of fun in this last video. Why not just make this thing bounce around for a little bit and then I'll fork it. I'll change it. I'll tweak it. And sometimes that turns into something like totally new. Sometimes it stays the same as just like an augmented version upon the last one. You can think about like remixing a song or something like that. I'll occasionally I'll come up with something and then I'll fork it. And by the time I'm done with the fork, it will be something completely different or it'll be a slightly different version of the thing that we had. And I'll usually do all of those. Code examples and everything while I'm working on the outline. So everything has its kind of a perfect flow, you know, like right now we did the 3D course, so, or I'm working on it and it's like the first 10 videos show you what you need to know to understand, like just the basic syntax of working in 3D with something like Svelte Cube. Then we do a project, then we get into some more interesting stuff. Then we do like a project that is using some more of that interesting stuff. And then we're kind of like drip feeding the skills and we're not showing you all of the API at once. So that way you can actually make interesting things or things that will like at least give you those bits of excitement from working on something. I don't know me personally, like when I'm really excited about a topic, which I'm sure it's pretty common when I'm really excited about a topic, I want to consume a lot of material. I want to work really hard. I want to like experiment with it and just try all sorts of new things. But when I'm just doing it for, you know, business or whatever, it's a slog and it's a grind and I'd rather not be doing it. When you're just trying to get work done versus like exploring and playing. Totally. Yeah. I'm very much a motivation. I mean, like that type of motivation for me is really big. Cause I've always been the type of person who does like to experiment a lot with things. You know, my background before web was in motion graphics and after effects stuff, and you can just tinker with that stuff all day long. And so like, I've always been a bit of a, just a tinkerer in that regard. Formal approaches to instructional design or other ways to think about the instructional design aspect of creating courses, not necessarily, you know, I think there's a lot of learning that I've had to have done, like we all end up having to learn a lot, I think in our lives. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, a lot of it kind of has either been like nothing formal, so no formal anything, but maybe through the school of YouTube comments and people being rude to you online, so like I've had enough of this sucks for these reasons. Or you did like, for instance, you told me at the title of this video is going to be installing WordPress plugin. Then you didn't do that for two whole minutes. I was just thinking like, Oh yeah, you're right. Okay. So there's no general like actual validated learning structure for me, but I've been recording for so long that I feel like I've gotten enough comments from people that they've either told me what they liked or disliked or whatever it's been honed down over the years. I was wondering if learner feedback affected the design of your courses and besides the comment section, are you using the, I mean, you said this already that you're mostly exploring your personal interests, but like how does that feedback loop come into play? And do you do any sort of like testing with users before you release a course? We don't do a lot of testing with users specifically, but we do have a discord channel that's like always active and I'm in there 24 seven because it's how my team communicates, but also like, yeah, how everyone in our community talks about things and I get it kind of a good idea for our community in general and our users there based on what they're talking about. But we also do have like the ability to vote on course topics that at least gives me some feedback in terms of like what they're interested in. And we have the user submission things, which people do use. We, I mean, we get a lot of people asking for various topics. I think one of the challenges with, especially with video driven courses is maintaining the course over time. And like you said, this stuff is always changing. What sort of effort do you put into maintaining courses or is that, you know, something, is it always sort by new is the best approach? Yeah, we've kind of had, um, I don't know. I have a bit of like, just anxiety around that, that topic in general. I released like a massive, I released a massive react native courses. Like one of my first premium courses when I was trying to migrate off of YouTube. And it was like, I put so much time and so much effort into it. And not only like, was it out of date, like the next week, cause it was react native, but like it didn't do great in sales because of, you know, now I have to rerecord this whole module like a month after I released it. And it's just so much like, I can't believe I wasted so much time doing that. And then I've put out other courses on CSS and CSS variables and, you know, browser APIs that are never going to change and they're like evergreen. So it's been a bit of a learning experience for me. I've, I try to, I try to like really minimize usage of extraneous libraries wherever possible, because one small API change can just goof up your whole course for, you know, forever. So I try to stick pretty close to the Dom APIs, but a lot of the stuff we're dealing with nowadays are frameworks and they're this or that they're getting changed versions, completely just dismantling your entire course. And what I end up doing more often than not is like doing a completely new version of the course a year later or two years later, three years later, instead of. Trying to patch it or keep it up to date. It's just like, all right, this one is now out of date. Let's scrap it. Let's put out a new one. Kind of deprecation, right? Where you put a version number on the old one and put the new one out and tell people that the new one exists. Totally. Yeah. And we're often trying to keep things a little bit more scoped to version numbers. Like people often ask about release dates, which we have added. I was resistant to adding release dates for a while because I didn't want people to think like, all right, this course that came out two years ago, which is still super relevant. I don't want people to feel like that content is too old just because we're on the web and everything is a hyperspeed. I would rather like that release date be the versions that the application's tied to. And I suppose that's something we should probably do. We just haven't done, but yeah, it's a constant challenge for me and one that like I do occasionally lose total sight of that and I'm like, I'm just going to pick this thing because I'm really super interested in it. And then half a year later, I'm like, man, I should have picked something a little bit more grounded in the APIs rather than something that's brand new. Do you think, is it, do you have any flagship courses or ones that are like a particular draw that they get people in to your kind of ecosystem or how do you look at that? Yeah. And I think there's some of my favorite courses that I've like done. We have a design systems course with CSS and it's all about how to use CSS variables and you know, like classless CSS to build out your foundational CSS before like really going ham or using frameworks or this or that. And then we have like a modern CSS layouts course, which is like, how do you use CSS grid and Flexbox to build several different layouts? Like we build TweetDeck and we build like more interesting layouts like TweetDeck, but also like very generic layouts that you'd typically see. And those courses have been really rock solid for me for a long time. And I think a part of it too, is that like, that's some of my favorite stuff. I always feel really like, man, I should just do another course on interesting CSS stuff because it's the stuff that I'm most interested in personally, and it's the stuff that doesn't go out of date the fastest. So like, maybe I should just nail that down a little bit more, but then, you know, then there's things like Svelte Cubed calling my name and now I have to do a 3D course on Svelte. Do you ever consider breaking off? I know, you know, you have level up, but breaking off and doing like a standalone CSS jam, for instance, to where you take that and kind of take that love and develop it into its own thing, is that something you ever consider or are you pretty focused on, on kind of keeping it under one roof? I'm pretty focused, but mostly just because of time, you know, we have a two-year-old and a four-year-old and I would just like, I don't get like a full eight hour workday based on when they come home from daycare, my wife works full-time and like, it's just a struggle to get all of my stuff done. And even before this year, really, I was doing 12, 24 video courses a year. So. Cause you were trying to hit one a month, I think was, if I remember right, that was your goal, right? So I've been doing one a month since like 2017 on LevelUp. And now we have a guest author, every other author. So my, my 12 has gone down to six courses and that has been like a tremendous life improvement for me in general. Yeah. I mean, when the pandemic first hit, you know, we had two kids at home, two young kids at home and my office and my wife, and I'm trying to record, she's trying to get work done. We got two kids running around. Yeah, I had to do 12 courses that year and it was impossible. So like ever since then, I've just been like totally burnt out on it. And I've been doing my six courses a year and feeling really happy about that. Yeah. I noticed it. And I noticed the recent addition to the platform is that you are now including guest instructors. How has that changed? Like at the business level or kind of process level, adding folks in to, to create courses with you. It was always really scary for me. I'm not a great communicator in terms of like organizing things or planner. I maybe I'm not a great planner. Yeah. I'm not a good manager. I've never really had that role. And so for me, it was always really tough to coordinate things. I would have interest to people wanting to do courses, wanting to be involved in the platform. And I would just be like, okay, cool. Yeah. We'll get you in and then just not have the bandwidth to take care of it. So part of the biggest thing was we hired on, we hired on a guy who was a node developer for us. He did like amazing work, but he also just happened to be an exquisite planner. And so he started, he basically set up the whole flow for how we connect with content creators and how we get involved. And ever since then, it's been way easier. I'm coordinating with people and I'm lining things up and I'm feeling really good about it. But even just to get that process in place, to get started, wasn't super easy for me. But I, you know, people are out there making really amazing courses. And like, there's so many people who are exquisite at teaching. So it's really nice to be able to have people on the platform. And, you know, part of like our whole goal with doing this is, is trying to like enrich everyone's lives, you know, who's involved in it. Right. And I used to work at a record label, Ghostly International, and they had this like absurd royalty rate for their like their sales. Like basically every other record label is giving you like a one one or like one to 10 percent on sales or something. And they were giving like 60 percent. And like, I just remember the artist being like, wow, this is so cool. This is like how they should do it. And I've always like really wanted to, if I was going to bring other people in to have it be in that sort of capacity where we could pay people based on streams. So they get paid like a percentage of the total revenue for that month based on their stream numbers, as well as for sales. So like if they're bringing people to watch their course and people are watching the course, then they're going to get paid directly. And again, this was like all stuff that this developer, his name's Tom Allen. He's really talented. He he really helped us with and helped us get going with. And yeah, just a big upgrade for all of our lives over here. I'd love to if you're willing to kind of describe the flow and the process, the time Tom had has brought in to level up. I'd love to hear more about that. Yeah, I think it's just more of an organization. You know, we had GitHub issues and things like that where people could leave issues and connect and whatever. But no, he basically just went ham on Google Forms, made a bunch of Google Forms. And that was really it. Let's have a submission form. Let's have a content creators form. You can vet them these ways. We have all this information. And I think he had worked at Pluralsight before. So he had a little bit of he had a little bit of experience in this world of online education and how working with content creators. So he had definitely like a just that that right amount of experience and knowing, you know, how a lot of these flows can work. So that's really it was more or less like instead of just emailing people here and there, we're going to have a process. The process is they submit the form. We vet the form next. We do a one hour long interview. Then we connect with them. We depends on their experience, how much we have to monitor what they're doing or not doing. And mostly we're working with content creators who have been, you know, fairly active either on YouTube or anything like that. Or we often have to see quite a bit of work from them before signing them up for good, getting people going. But since we're not trying to do it too much, right, we're doing one every other month, it's been pretty nice to coordinate everything to the point where now I don't have to worry about what the heck I'm doing for next month's course, I can worry about the month after and put more time into that and, you know, feel less less burdened by the stress of having to come up with a new topic every single month. Speaking of burdens and stresses, you've created your own. And I'm wondering why. Why not just use something off the shelf? You know, go rent real estate from Teachable or Podia or whatever. Why not? Why not just go that route instead of building your own playground? Yeah, a lot of it is because, you know, I get to get really deep into stuff with my own platform, right? Like building, building the whole UI in SvelteKit recently was a way for me to say, oh, I actually have found the pitfalls here. I've understood, like, what are the common things you're going to hit when building a major app? And I think that's like really helped me. And I'm the type of person who does churn their code base too much, right? But in the same regard, like rewriting my components from React functions to React hooks was a big way for me to really, truly understand them. And so it does act as like a sandbox. But then again, it's, you know, it's a full on platform that we've been building for since 2014. I think we started initially on Meteor and it's been shifted here and there. And now we're on SvelteKit in a Node API with Mercurius. But I didn't actually pick anything off the shelf because really at the time there wasn't a ton of options. We had a Drupal site that did a lot of the stuff for us. But I wasn't a skilled PHP developer, and I probably could have hacked it together. But I was just feeling like it'd be really nice if I had full control over this thing. And even at the time when I first built it, I had two separate sites. I had the streaming service, which was just the streaming service. And then I had an e-commerce store that was for T-shirts and mugs and what, which I also wrote just for who knows, because I wanted to torture myself. I wrote an e-commerce platform, right? And then I ended up merging those two sites into one. And then I got to use an e-commerce code to then sell the digital goods and the tutorials. And yeah, at the end of the day, there was not a ton of great options at the time. I think if I was doing it again today, I might even use something like Ghost and because that's up my alley, using something like Ghost. They actually the initial version of the site was written in Reactive Commerce or Reaction Commerce. Reactive. I never touched that. I don't know what that is. So it was initially also a Meteor based platform that they moved and then it was since been sold to MailChimp. And it was a really good platform. But again, to get it to do exactly what I wanted it to do, I would have had to do so much work to it. And at that point, I was like, well, I might as well, if I'm having to design these systems or work within someone else's design, I might as well design them myself from scratch. And sometimes that like that mentality for me is something that other people need to say, don't do it. Yeah, I wish in my life that more people would have said don't do that because I still suffer today from like my week two decisions in 2014 when I sat down to write this platform. My friend Jared Palmer says you should just do this in WordPress. And that I was like, I was like that left me shook. And I was like, what do you mean? He's like, look, they got the plug ins. They have all this stuff. You're literally just producing a blog. You could just use WordPress. And I'm like, that doesn't sound like any fun. I know. Yeah, I know. It's it was a huge problem. And I was like, yeah, but I want to be able to do this and that. I want to be able to have it do this. Like I too much of that. It has to be exactly the way that I I envision it or see it or whatever. And yeah. What are the essential features of your course platform for you? Like what are you know, not just a general course platform, but for you, what are the essential features for me? I really wanted people to be able to like purchase things as well as do a subscription. And actually, for I think before we had the subscription at all, it was you'd purchase them in one off, one off. And it was mostly because we didn't have the library to support it.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So it was like, well, who's going to subscribe if there's like two courses here. So we built up the library and then did the subscriptions. But for me, I really wanted to have that connection where somebody could subscribe, get access to everything, or buy the same thing on an individual basis and have the same experience with that course and just have those features be like nice and easy baked in all LinkedIn together. And another thing is I really like writing admin tools and dashboards and things like that. So like having my own platform, it was really easy for me to get the data I need, get the tools I need, build it in a way that is like our video uploader. Right. We use mux for our video platform. Our video uploader is like really great because I got to work with YouTube's video uploader for so long. I know which things I like and don't like about it. And now I can have my own video uploader drag and drop the file in automatically does this and that and pumps this thing up to, to mux. But like for me, I just, I've really just straight up enjoy writing that stuff. And then maybe that's part of the problem is that I'm just at first and foremost, I'm a developer by all of the, by all of the markers. I just really want to make things. I just find that joy in it. Well, it's the part of your job that brings you joy. And I think that's a really good feature for a course platform versus something off the shelf where you just use it, like you're just consuming it, which is enough for a lot of people. And I think that's fine too. But you know, like as, as somebody that can make it, you do, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, right. So that's interesting to me that you talk about the subscription versus the single purchases. And I'm wondering if you don't mind sharing, like what is like in terms of revenue drivers at this point for the platform, what, which do you see like pushing it, the single purchases or subscriptions, definitely the subscriptions. And the single purchase is like a very small part of our revenue, but we do offer it because I know I've had people express to me that like their companies won't allow them to get a subscription or a reoccurring bill or whatever. So that's largely why we did it was so that anyone who wants to learn like one particular topic out of this bunch could just say, all right, I've been given, you know, this amount of money from work, so I can just buy this one singular thing. And so it's largely available for those people. And at this point, like it makes up a small percentage, but like the features there, so it's not like we, you know, it's not like we, we're not going to use it. So I would say it's maybe about like 10% of our revenue, which yeah, not bad. Non-trivial, but it's not the main revenue driver. Yeah. And largely we haven't focused on it too much in terms of like, we're not like the most metricable, like we're not like devouring analytics to get people to buy things a la carte either. So it's, you know, it exists as it is. So one of the things that I learned pretty early in, in selling products online in this space over the last few years was that people want you to have purchase power parody like West boss does. And I was wondering, is that something you've been able to implement or do like, it was like, I couldn't every, we just got a lot of ton of emails and it was all these referencing West and I think it's amazing. And it kind of forced us to do it. And is that something you've explored as well? Yeah. It's like been perpetually on our list forever. And the, like, honestly, the only reason it hasn't been done is because like for sales, it wouldn't be too difficult for individual sales, but I don't know what do you use for subscriptions for your merchant, but we use Braintree and like Braintree's API is such a nightmare sometimes that I just, I would honestly stay awake thinking about how am I going to implement P in Braintree and have it work in a way that I'm like happy with. It's, it's just like, it's always a kind of one of those things that like, it's very frustrating for me to work in that API. So we implemented it in Ruby. That's how we ended up doing it and did a custom implementation and we use Stripe and thank you for like affirming my decision to use Stripe because their API is actually wonderful. It was, it's challenging though. And we've done it, we've done a couple implement implementations and I think there's services now that'll do some of it, but they're, you know, they don't fit into everything. It's a hard problem, but it's like one that's interesting and kind of good to solve I think at the end of the day. I agree. And it's something that like I really want to do, but man, yeah. Like I said, those Braintree APIs, I said something, I said something about Braintree on Syntex a couple of weeks ago and I had some people from PayPal reach out to me asking me about my experience. I was just like, Oh no, I don't. Yeah. I honestly, I do, I do probably wish I would have used Stripe overall just because I had more experience with their APIs even back then when I started it. And it wasn't all the time, but I just got so many requests for PayPal. I didn't want to maintain two separate subscriptions and went Braintree. And yeah, yeah. That makes sense. And I took the opposite cause I just don't support PayPal. And you know, like, you know, like you're, it's kind of six and one half a dozen, it's trade-offs, right? At the end of the day, when you're designing a system like this, you're having to make trade-offs. Was there anything that has surprised you either technically or otherwise while you've been building a course platform over these years? Yeah. You know what? It's, it surprises me just how, like how little some users will look for things before like sending an email. Right. Yeah. Like that gets me all the time. Like I'll get an email that just be like, can you cancel my subscription? And it's like, not even with the same email address that they signed up for with the site, but even like, would you email Netflix and just say, please cancel my Netflix subscription? Yes. People do constantly all day long. It's my, my, my guess. I don't know. I don't work at Netflix. I would imagine they do as well, but like it's so wild how many emails I get from people that either just like they didn't try or whatever, or people say, I can't believe that you charged me a second time. The support, like the, just the people, the questions and support is maybe what you're saying. Like, I agree with that. Oh yeah. It's been mind boggling to me. Do you get any, have you, have you hired help for that or do you handle in all the support yourself these days? How does that work for you? 50 50. Yeah. It depends on the problem. Some things we do require a little bit more hands-on for me, but yeah, that's actually been what part of like what we've been working on with making, I guess, the platform better by like hiring people, right. Whether that is marketing people or developers or anyone trying to expand just a little bit. Like I don't want a huge company here, but I do need help to the point where I'm not answering all of the customer support, doing all of the video editing doing well, it's like, it's, it was too much for me to do all of it. And you said earlier that you kind of weigh, you know, you're not a manager. And at the same time, you need to have that, you know, like you need help to kind of do what you want to do and live your life. So how have you been dealing with that? Cause that's trade-offs too, I would think. Yeah. It's been challenging for me, but I've gotten a lot better at it. You know, a couple of years ago, I probably would have been a lot worse about it, but we have a handful of people who work on the site here and there for us. We have a full-time marketing person who started in November. We like, we want to keep it small. We want to keep it tight knit here, but the same regard, like just trying to develop the systems, prepare for people to be able to access things without me. Right. Like every single customer support request should be able to be accomplished, finished via the UI of the site that like somebody could do if they had the knowledge of using Facebook. Right. We want to make all these things like really easy for anyone that brings on. And then that brings us more development. So then I'm heads down trying to develop these things or hire someone to do the development on these things to have the features just to support a customer service person to take things off my plate. So it's like to get things off my plate, I have to first add 10 or 12 more things onto my plate first. And we did a whole big list of all of the things that I'm doing in the business and how we can reduce them or fix them or make them a little bit more processized, a little bit more streamlined or have the right people take it, take control of them. And it's been endlessly amazing for me because now, again, I'm getting to focus more time on doing courses. I'm getting to do like focus more time on even doing YouTube content, which is something that I stopped doing. Kind of going back to the root. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have a YouTube channel that has 340,000 subscribers on it. And it's like, I'm not using a lot utilizing that at all for anything. So now it's like, okay, well, I have some free time because we have third-party content creators. I'm not doing the marketing. I'm not doing all of the customer support. I'm not doing the editing anymore. So I can use that time to crank out three YouTube videos a week. And that's actually really easy for me, you know, the video part, like sitting down and recording technical videos is something you got absolutely down. I would suspect at this point. Yeah. I would have to imagine I've done like 3000 plus video tutorials, which yeah, just a wild amount of time. I have no idea how that happened. So you've recorded this long-term podcast with West Boston. I mentioned it earlier, but like Syntax FM and you know, it is extremely popular, people love it. How does that relate to your business that you're running? You know, like, does it affect that? Does doing that work? Does that effort over time, do you see like kind of return on investment in your time invested there? Yeah, totally. And you know what I, one of the best parts about doing the podcast with West is that we have like such shared interests, right. That like, there's really nothing better than like popping on a zoom call and just chatting with him about something that, yeah, it is. It's like seriously just catching up. And most of the time, like sometimes. Like one of us will have the lead on an episode or an idea like Wes is more experienced in this. So he'll take the lead or I'm more experienced in this. And it's almost like, you know, you're doing a teaching each other back and forth kind of thing. And honestly, it's been awesome for me to get the level up tutorials name out there a little bit more. What's funny is that just because I never put my name out there that much for like the first two years of the podcast, people were like, Oh, it's the level up tutorials guy. I had no idea. Like people didn't know my name because I, you know, I have a Polish last name and whatever, but people didn't know me by my name. So they only knew me as the YouTube guy. And so that was like a really nice thing to be able to maybe attach some of the work I had already done to the work I was doing like presently. And honestly, it does. It opens me up to like learning a lot of really like newer things. It opens me up to like being maybe a little bit more on some of the later stuff that I could then take in to do courses. But it also gives me, you know, we hear from our audience a lot, so it gives me years into what people are interested in or what people are wanting to do. Do you have any sort of audacious goals for your course platform? Are you thinking, is there anything where you're thinking really big and what you might do over the next years or what have you? I don't, I don't know. Nothing like huge. No, my, my goals are, I would say they're pretty measured. I have like maybe large goals in terms of like, I would like to get more people helping here and there. Right. But like those aren't crazy goals. And I wouldn't necessarily say any of my goals are audacious to the point where, I don't know, they're that big. It's mostly, they're mostly smart. Like what, where's this going to be in two years? Where's this going to be in five years? Would I like to be doing 12 videos, 12 courses a year in two years? No. Okay. Let's, let's take a look at that one and maybe let's work towards it. So I've always been definitely like a smart goals kind of person in terms of like, I used to do monthly results, you know, like everyone does yearly resolution. So I do monthly resolutions, these big life goals that these are the things I would like to make some progress towards this month. And I'm fairly good at chipping away at something for a long period of time until you're good at it. You know, you had mentioned before the dance stuff that I do, like I started dancing when I was 18, like long after, like you're supposed to, like you're supposed to start when you're like 10 so that you can get really good by the time you're 18. So I started when I was 18 and people thought it was really weird that I was like learning at that age and whatever. And you know, now I've been all over the U S entering competitions and doing all that stuff for so long. I just showed up to practice three days a week. I just showed up and then, you know, 10, 10, 12 years later, I can do just about anything I wanted to do in the dance space. And that was the same way with YouTube. I just showed up three days a week to record and same with the podcast. I mean, we've been doing the podcast and we haven't missed a single episode. So the first one, we've done two episodes a week. We've we show up every single Monday, unless there's something really bad. Actually, I've missed one episode. Wes has made every episode. I missed one episode because of the birth of my second child. Yeah. It's a decent excuse. Yeah. But even then, like, you know, all of that stuff, just if I can get it on my schedule and on my calendar, that I'm like really good at showing up and doing it and then making that little chunk of progress each day, showing up and sticking to it and doing the work is such a, it's such a good skill and habit to be in. And you reap the rewards, right? If you don't do that, it never happens. You won't make progress. You won't get good, but like practice and, you know, keep doing it and kind of get through the, get through those initial kind of suffering points and you'll, you can really do a lot of stuff in this life, I think. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Cause like when I started recording video tutorials in 2012, I like had no, no intention of making a career out of it or even eventually, you know, starting a business, doing video streaming or tutorials. I was just a developer and I was doing those videos essentially for fun or to like, maybe make some rent money for you from YouTube, but you know, just several years go by of doing it. And all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah. Turns out you've gained a skill from doing that. That's awesome, Scott. I really appreciate it and I appreciate the work that you do. And thanks for taking the time to chat. Well, thanks. Thanks. I, Hey, I appreciate, especially when we had our group in the past, you guys like just tore, tore me apart on some of the things I was doing on my site. So I definitely appreciate all of the help you've given to me over the years too. Cheers. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm really curious to talk to you about Notion Mastery and Notion in general and particularly using Notion as a course delivery platform. Like a course on Notion makes a lot of sense to me. Like Notions, you know, one, it's a blank slate so you can do whatever you want in it. So some sort of rails in which to ride on to use it as a effective platform makes a ton of sense. But a course about Notion that is delivered through Notion, that's really quite fascinating to me. First, before we dig into all that, I was wanting to ask you, how do you personally approach learning new complex topics when you sit down to learn something new? What's your general strategy or approach? If any, maybe you don't have one. It's pure chaos. I like that. Chaos and obsession. I'm like, okay, who do I know that's talking about this? What resources do I already have? What have I collected that's related to this? What books do I have? I go a little nuts, deep diving on it and just I want to consume everything all at once. I'll often hire at least a couple coaches or other people and I just immerse myself in it. And one nerdy thing I like to do is pick a couple skills to learn each quarter. So I'll be like, okay, Q1 hiring. I don't know anything about hiring and delegating and management. That's going to be my thing. And so I'm like reading all the books and just having conversations with people too. Like who knows about this stuff and what can I learn about it? So I throw myself into the deep end. Do you go to Amazon and get like all the five-star review books or do you have constraint in your library acquisitions? I actually think I lean more maybe toward personal recommendation, mastermind groups or Slack groups or whatever. I'm like who has a really good recommendation in this area or sometimes Twitter. But yeah, I'd say reaching out to people that I already know that I hold in high esteem that would have some- Somebody that's like already an expert or partially an expert or has an interest in the subject matter. I also like the idea of hiring coaches and I think people often don't consider that. We grew up with teachers, but like the idea of hiring a personal coach to more efficiently learn a new skill is really, it's been effective for me anyway, like to get over that initial what is going on in a new domain. Absolutely. Yeah. I'm a huge fan of coaches, just coaches and experts. Like I've mentioned before, I've hired an instructional designer and just people that know their stuff and can shortcut that learning big time. So I'm a huge fan of hire the experts, speed it up. What do you think makes for a good teacher? I'm sure this is going to be personal preference, but- Yeah, yeah. It is. Totally. That's fine. I think a really good teacher is someone who can create a safe space to learn where you don't feel like an idiot, even if you're learning something really complex. So do they leave room for exploration? Do they foster engagement? Do they bring something dynamic and interesting to the content? Because there's lots of people teaching the same stuff online. But I think often people's delivery style can really connect with you in a different way. And I do think there's room for a lot of different types of teachers, but I do like to think about how does that teacher show up energetically? What do they bring into the table? Are they keeping my attention? Because short attention span, especially when you've got ADHD. So I'm like, let's get to the point. Let's go. How do we keep this interesting? It's always a wave too, right? Because you have to go in depth, but also keep it interesting. So it's like the push and the pull and the cadence of a good teacher is really hard to... I think the safe space for exploration where you're almost encouraged to fail somewhat has been something I've seen important too, where it's not just lecturing you with the answers. It's like you go out there and do some stuff and figure it out also is an important part of the process. And a good teacher to me would know... Yes, getting you to think differently. Yeah, exactly. Let you make your mistakes, but then examine them and the feedback cycle and that sort of thing. Absolutely. So Notion Mastery isn't your first course online and you've been doing this for a while. What turned the corner and decide, well, this is the subject matter that I want to explore for a longer period of time when you sat down to dig into Notion? There was this guy, Joel, at this mastermind that I was at. Okay. So at the time I was already playing with Notion. I was chatting about it, talking about it. I was getting a little obsessed about it. And I think you had said, this is a lightning in a bottle moment. You need to start a YouTube channel. You need to double down on this. And I definitely experienced that tension and resistance. And I was like, do I want to be known as the Notion person? Is that my legacy? Is that where I want to go right now? And I thought, fuck it. What if I just tried it? What would I lose to just try this as a chapter? Let's double down on this for a little bit and see how it goes. And so I think part of it was your encouragement. You just said, I think there's something here. And you pointed to it and just said, do the YouTube thing. I was like, all right, screw it. I'm just going to try it. I was terrified, but I thought, what do you got to lose to just try it for a couple months anyway? So I made the commitment that I would do a YouTube video on it every week for 12 weeks. And right around the same time, I think I had just done like a one-off Notion webinar that caught Notion's attention. And so ended up partnering with them doing their office hours. And so basically for those 12 weeks, it was a live event for Notion and then a YouTube video. So I think it probably felt like my face, like I was just always out there talking about Notion. And so it didn't take very long. It was like a three-month stint that it felt like I went from being relatively quiet on the internet to like, oh yeah, you should talk to Marie. She's the Notion girl. So it took on a life of its own that I wasn't really expecting. And then it didn't take long before people were like, if you make a course on this, I'll give you money. People were actually telling me that. And I thought, okay, there's something here and there's attraction that I had never experienced before with any of my other courses. And I thought, let's just, let's see where this goes. You mentioned YouTube. And I'm really curious because I have a, I've struggled personally to ever really use YouTube in a way that made sense to me. And I'm wondering, how did you get into that? And did you have a strategy going into YouTube other than you should really post some videos on YouTube, which maybe we all should, I don't know. But how did you get over that or get into that, I should say? It was very difficult. Like definitely making, certainly editing videos was not a skillset that I have, but I had done the technical aspects. Yeah. What do I edit with? What I record with? I just, I didn't really know much about it, but I thought you just have to start somewhere. There's no way you're going to get good at something unless you try. And I had done a hundred day video challenge before that was me trying to get out of my shell a little bit and learn how do you actually edit it when you're just using your phone and you don't have any fancy equipment, like just use what you've got. So that was helpful for just getting over that initial hurdle. There is something scary, of course, when you make a piece of content, it's available for however many people and Notion's got a huge audience. So even just putting a couple of crappy videos out there, they were getting a huge amount of hits very quickly and people being like, your hair is ratty or just making, but it was like, oh, this is a whole new world. Like not everybody is nice on the internet and you're going to have to grow a little bit of a thick skin. And so I just, I can't even explain it, but I just thought it's more interesting to me if I want to make an impact and if I want to teach people, I'm going to have to get comfortable doing this. And this is going to be the best way to do it. This is where Notion users are looking for their answers. So get over yourself and put some crappy, you know, first draft videos up. And then the comments are what start feeding the ideas. Oh, how did you do X? And I was like, oh, actually, that's a really great question. Suddenly it feeds the content engine of, okay, if I'm going to do this, I'm going to need to teach this. And you can start to see how there's just so many opportunities for content creation when you just put a, you know, first couple videos out. Comment section is a double-edged sword. It sounds like there's at some point where you have to ignore the detractors and that's often easier said than done. How were you able to do that? Were you able to balance the good versus the evil nature of the comment section? Definitely. Yeah. Like I think when you start to see that you're actually helping people, to me, that feeds my soul. When I know that I've done a thing and someone's like, holy crap, thank you. You just solved the thing. I've been banging my head against the wall. That to me is very motivating and it's way more motivating to know I'm helping 10 people for every, or maybe even a hundred people for every one or two people that are like, this is too slow or too confusing or whatever it is. So you just learn the cadence and you start to learn how to approach things with a bit more polish and you just get better every single time you do a new video. How do you think the YouTube channel, are you still doing that practice? Is that something that you're still up to? I only did six videos last year. You toned it down a lot? I've toned it down mostly because I've been focused on the course and it takes a lot more time, I think, to make a polished lesson video, for example, than it is to just do a YouTube video. Maybe that's just my own issue with that, but it feels like a YouTube video needs to, I don't even know if it takes more time necessarily, but because it feels like this evergreen piece of content that gets a pretty big audience, you want it to be more polished where course videos, I can switch those up easily, but once it's out into the ether on YouTube, it's there. So I want to put more care and time and attention and make sure it's really well placed. So maybe I'm scrappier in the course than I am on YouTube. I think one of the interesting things on YouTube is to go, if you look at prolific YouTubers and trace back to what they're currently doing, where they have the, they have lighting behind them and plants and it's a nice set or however they approach it. But when you trace them back and look at their early videos and watching the progression of folks on YouTube, it's really interesting because it generally goes from that scrappy, I'm editing this on my phone into now I use Adobe Premiere and I have practical lighting and set design and that sort of thing. I think it's fascinating to look at that progression. I'm also curious, with YouTube and the course, how did that practice or the content even that you're making feed or fuel the course? Was it almost beta or research for the, what eventually became the course or is there less of a distinct relationship? I think I started the YouTube stuff in late August and I think I had launched the pilot of my course by late October and I didn't have, I didn't have course content ready, but I said, Hey, I'm going to make a course on this. We're going to do live calls every week. If you're interested, join here. And I pre-sold it. So I didn't, and I was very honest about the fact that I didn't have content created, but you were going to co-create this with me. Like I'm going to build it based on your needs when you show up in the calls. I'm a big fan of doing live first, then you turn into the polish lesson. So any chance where you get to interact with people and just see where that confusion is, I think is incredible. So I'm a big fan of doing those pilot live, like workshop something first, do a webinar first, and then you can go feed it into the course and polish it. I think I was probably getting most of my traction, maybe on Twitter, definitely a little bit of YouTube. And then by the time I launched the course, it made about 10,000 in the first week of not having a very big audience. Just like, Hey, if I made this course, would you be interested? So when it sold with no email funnel, no, like hardly anything, I thought, okay, there's something here. If with very little effort, I was able to make $10,000. Okay. What, what if I took this a little bit more seriously? And so it took, I'd say probably took five months to go from complete beta non-existent course to like having a course that I could remove beta from and actually sell it. So it definitely took some time. And the whole while I'm still making YouTube videos too. So the YouTube videos and comments were feeding into the course and stuff like that. But when I look at my intake form of people joining the course, it was like 80% found me through YouTube. So it was definitely a huge driver to the core sales for sure. Yeah, that makes sense. So how did you launch the first course? You did the workshops and I'm assuming that was, I don't know if that was webinars or how did you sell tickets and how did you get people actually to come and show up? What's your approach for that? Cause I think people use different systems for that sort of thing from just PayPal me or, you know, like Venmo me the cash or, you know, are you using a platform to achieve that? Or what were you using? The first time was just Gumroad. It was just a, yeah, it was just a Gumroad payment checkout here. And then I invited them manually into my Notion workspace, into my own like personal Notion workspace, which is hilarious looking back. And I think we did that for the first hundred people. And I was like, okay, this is not sustainable. Like I'm literally manually inviting people in. And so it would be like, hold on, you know, like you sort of feel like you're always on call with your notifications. It's not really a great user experience. It was fine for the beginning while I was just testing the waters. I was like, okay, we need to figure out a way to better automate this and moved over to Thrivecart and then got an enterprise account with Notion, which allowed me to be able to give people a team login code. So they actually become a member of the space as soon as they click on that link. So that was one of the technical moves that we made to make that process a little bit easier. But there was no launching or there was no formal strategy. There was no like funnel or anything like that. Just in time finding what you need and applying it based on maybe recommendations or just even looking around. I did that recently and just asked what people would use. And we're using Tally for forms now. Your recommendation. And I think that's a great way to do it because it feels, I don't know, especially with a new product, if you aren't launching products on a monthly or semi-annual basis, which I don't think most of us generally are, like there's always something new, right? Like the state of the art is always different. So you have people and they're coming into your Notion space and it's your personal Notion space. This is where your journals are. And, you know, like I've seen you use Notion in a very kind of robust way that I think is interesting. Yeah. There was like a course page that lived in my space. And so suddenly, even when you're adding names to other pages on your space, every possible guest comes up. So I was like, OK, this is a bit untenable to have these folks in my personal space. So we definitely had to make the move and get an official Notion space that was an enterprise account that's separate from my own personal business account and had to switch that over. So there were, I mean, anyone who joined in the beginning has probably seen a hilarious number of iterations where it's like, oh, now we're on this thing. Oh, now they're using Tally. Oh, now they do feedback forms every week. Oh, now they're doing live workshops. Like we've definitely continued to evolve it. And I have to say it doesn't really feel like, oh, there was like a point, like course is finished and now we're moving on to next phase. I think I can't help myself. Like I want to make it better. So we're always revamping. I'm sure for some people that probably feels quite frustrating. They're like, oh, like it's never the same when I log in. But that's the nature of the beast with also Notion changes their features really frequently. And it just kind of is what it is. So we're always trying to figure out, like, how can we make this process smoother for people to move through it and get what they need? So I think it's interesting that you use the enterprise approach versus like something like member spaces. I think that is it member spaces or other approaches. And what was the was it cost or features or what had you think about Notion enterprise in terms of the approach? I mean, one as an ambassador that does a lot of, you know, events for Notion and that sort of thing, it doesn't cost me anything to have an enterprise account where it would like most, it's not really tenable. I think for most people to actually run an enterprise. It's not too bad, 240 a year or something. So if you're priced accordingly, I think you could probably pull it off. But it's per member. Remember, but if your course was priced, you know, I was wondering, actually, I was curious mostly because I, you know, you charge $750 for your course. And if you're paying $250 per seat, and that would be, you know, cost prohibitive, but as a perk of your ambassadorship, they allow that. And I think that's fantastic. And one, you know, you're out there really doing a lot of work for them. So it's well-deserved. Yeah, it's not like some sort of special, it's like you're actually out there working and spreading the word about their product. So that's a good business sense on their part too. But yeah, in terms of choosing that, I think partly it was if I'm teaching a course about mastering Notion, I want to show, I want the actual experience of taking the course to be part of the education itself to see, oh, shit, I didn't know you could do that with Notion. Oh, whoa, that's interesting. I thought, actually, how far can I push the platform in terms of what can we do in terms of online teaching and having a forum, like we used to have a forum that was actually built in Notion before we moved to Circle. So there's things like that, that, okay, what is Notion good at? Where is it limited that, you know, it evolves over time. But I think it's just a really interesting, there's no difference in the interface between an admin and a student. Like we're all looking at the same page. I think that makes content updates really easy. The linking system, just being able to mention other things really easily. It's easier to manage than a tool like MemberSpace, for example, with just the sheer scale of lessons and content and resources that we have. With MemberSpace, there was an element of locking and setting up links that was just that extra beat. It just took a lot more time to set these kinds of things up. We still have lots of clients that use MemberSpace for smaller resource libraries and things like that. I think it's really great. But I just really wanted to see if people actually taking the course could be a little surprised at how easy or how beautiful it could be to create these interesting experiences. I think it's also really cool because I think one of the challenges in teaching anything is the separation of the educational material with the environment in which you learn, right? Even where you have to have stuff on one monitor and another, where if you're learning Notion in Notion, it's like there's this practical aspect of being able to be right in the environment where you're learning about the environment that you're currently learning about. I'm a big fan of metaspirals. I love things that eat themselves. That's pretty fantastic. Yeah. And one of the weird things too we had to figure out was, well, they're reading about it and learning about it, but then they also have their own workspace. And so one of the things we did in the new version too is encourage people to have those new windows. Have your own Notion workspace open in one window, have the other space open here. It's how to switch quickly between the two and just encouraging people to build along as they're watching. So don't just watch passively, actually have your own workspace open and make some time for it. Yeah, there's all sorts of quirks about it, but I do think it's just an interesting approach, I think. I think there's other people doing courses on Notion. I don't think most of them are actually hosted in Notion. So I think that's interesting. Yeah. I've only seen a couple of different courses, period, that are hosted in Notion, whether they're about Notion or not. And Shift Nudge, I don't know if you've ever seen that. Matt D. Smith, he does his in Notion. And that was the first time I personally experienced it. And I was like, this is really fantastic, actually. It just removes a bunch of technical hassle with the delivery platform for a course. And I don't know that it's appropriate for everything. And it does lack features, like you mentioned, you end up needing to go to Circle, the community platform for forums or whatever, for that sort of communication. And it's interesting to me, because in the past, you've participated in and built and ran a company that was a learning platform, right? Yes. Been there, done that. Yeah. What's a good reason to build your own bespoke, full stack course delivery platform, if there is one? I don't think that was really your goal, because you did not build that platform necessarily to deliver your own courses. Is that correct? Yeah. It was to help us with client work, because most of our clients were people that were running platforms, and none of the platforms were meeting the needs at the time. I think so many other platforms have come out even since we first launched Okie back in the day. But at some point, I think we realized, one, that, oh my gosh, the customer support for a $29 a month product is infinitely bigger than for a $1,000 training program. It's just such a different experience as a creator. I don't know how Ben handled those customer support, just people being rude, where it can be an error on their end. We're like, my Zapier is not working. I hate you. This company is terrible. And I'm like, for $29, my little heart can't take it. It's pretty good. I was like, your whole business runs on this platform, and it's making you money. And so anyway, there were parts of that, just it wasn't super fulfilling to be on the software side of it. I'm sure there's lots of reasons why it would be a really great idea. And if you're building it to deliver your own custom materials, and that was your primary motivation, because you're like, none of the platforms out there are solving this unique need that I have, great. But I think I'm not a programmer, so I don't have the skill set to be like, oh, it's worth doing that build. But I saw the time and effort and energy that goes into that, building it, maintaining it. And it's hard for me to justify that it would be worth customizing your own, unless your company is a training company. I could see if that's a core piece of what you deliver, then maybe that makes sense. But it's a lot of work. I've spent almost a decade on a course delivery platform as my primary job. And I'm always like, people, I want to build my own platform. And I'm like, if you really want to, I think that's a great thing, and you should pursue that. But maybe just make sure that's something you really want to do, because it's often easier to let... Yeah, it's often easier just to use a service, right? Which is why they exist. Though I can understand also why people wouldn't be satisfied with the current one. And I think that's what you did is more, it's more bespoke too, because you're taking things that exist and combining them in new and interesting ways. And then, you know, like dealing with the access and that kind of stuff. So there's like, you lose some of the bespokeness of it, but it's a constraint at the end of the day for the design of your community and through delivery and all that fun stuff. Probably not the most important. I don't know. It's all important at the end of the day. In the beginning, you were the instructional designer, just the designer in chief of all the things, wearing all the different hats for how you approach that. And how has that contrasted? Because now you collaborate with instructional designers and have built a team versus that solo thing that you were doing up front. How has that changed how you think about motion mastery? I'm so grateful for my team. Yeah, I've been working by myself for 10 years. I've been a, you know, sole proprietor mostly, even when Ben and I work together, we're pretty much working on our own projects. We're very independent people with our own creative whims and just, where does my energy today take me? And it was very chaotic and creative and amazing, but then key things don't get done or, you know, balls get dropped and that sort of thing. So I'm not the details person. I know I'm more the creative, the visionary. So I knew like ops was somebody, like I needed an operations person as my first hire for sure. And so even in that first selling the course, I think I hired Georgia pretty quickly on contract to help me because I'm like, oh, I need someone who can invite the guests in manually. And there was just all these moving parts and pieces. And I very quickly saw, okay, I'm able to get by with this right now, but this is not going to be scalable for me. There's just no way. And the part that's fun, of course, is making the notion content or like showing people what's possible. But if I'm busy, you know, answering customer support and just connecting up zaps and like that, you know, that's your soul leaving your body there to have Georgia on hand and for her to handle stuff so much more quickly. I can't even describe the relief that I felt when even just bringing her on part time. And so I think it took us maybe a year of working together on contract. And every month, I was like, how about more hours? How about more? Would you give up your other clients and just getting more and more of her time and building more trust? And just last year, it's been, I think it's been almost exactly a year that George has been my full-time ops person. You know, she's the ops person for okie dokie, but really the majority of her work and time spent is notion mastery related stuff. So it's really around our signature product. And then husband left his full-time job just a month or two ago. And so he's back at the company. And then just today, we hired our first, I guess we're calling her our chief learning officer. So she's going to be responsible for designing trainings. So it's, it's definitely evolved over time as we're just noticing the needs as, okay, what, where are these sticky points? Like, where am I feeling really stressed or where, what's fun? What's not fun. And I think it's been a big priority of our tiny little company that everybody is working with their best skillset. Like the stuff that Georgia loves doing, she gets to do and can't believe she's getting paid for it. And same here. I'm like, I can't believe I got to make content about this and get to connect with these incredible people around the world. This is a ridiculous job. I can't believe I made this job for myself. That's how I want it to feel or optimize for. Of course, there's always going to be stuff that we don't want to do. But so in figuring that out, it was like looking at the stuff that where am I dragging my feet? Where am I resisting stuff? Like what's being difficult. And in the redesign of the course and knowing that there were gaps and I was leaving people behind, it was going too fast or, you know, moving too quickly. I was like, I'm actually not the best person to teach beginners. Like I'm so advanced. I love pushing the boundaries of it that it's really hard to be like, click here to add a new entry to like, this is not, and I'm a very patient person and I love helping people. But I knew that in the material I was just leaving so many of those gaps. And so whenever I just noticed there's a gap where I'm like, this is not excellent. I know that I'm leaving people in the dust. I sort of figure out who do I need to hire to get that help with? And that's where I was like, okay, this has been too difficult to put what feels like this massive nebulous, so many moving parts, so many pieces of content. How do you distill this down into a course when, you know, you're going to have teams of 10 joining one person that's like a lawyer, like literally people from all over the world, every background and every intention. Do I need to niche more? Like there were lots of questions. I'm like, how do I?\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I distill this down into something that's digestible. So working with an instructional designer, you know, the first thing they do is they force you to get back to who is your idol student, who's the best person. Yeah. They start asking that question, right? It's like every time you always go back to who is the person that you're trying to serve. And that is still difficult because there are so many different people and ages, and I love that. But interesting patterns emerge and you start to develop for those patterns. And even noticing there's a gigantic percentage of people with ADHD in the course, and I was like, oh, that's funny. So many people in the course of ADHD, I didn't know I had ADHD at the time, but I was like, oh, that actually makes a lot of sense because people are watching my YouTube videos and being like, she thinks the way I do. So that was a really interesting insight. And being aware of that then allows me to fill those gaps and say, okay, what if I brought in Kat, who has a background in adult learning to actually deliver the beginner office hours, then she can, she just knows better how to meet someone at that beginner level and can pace herself in a way that is a little less chaotic. It's been a process to figure out what's, you know, who are the best people to make this up, but night and day, like there's no way I would have been able to like, you know, triple, triple our revenue as soon as you bring on one team member, like, okay, wow, what a difference it makes when I have someone handling ops and it's not up to me, like, I'm not that person. It's not where I should be spending my energy. You mentioned that you took a quarter off or one of your learning goals for a quarter was hiring. And I think that's interesting because hiring is, is a challenge and it's something that when you don't get it right, can be like a huge crush on you. And then you're affecting people's lives. And how do you approach hiring and, you know, finding people to fill these gaps in your process? This is such an interesting question because I, I don't, even though I learned about this stuff and there's all of the rules that you should follow around it or best practices. I know at the end of the day, I still go rogue and I, this person just feels energetically like the right fit, right? Yeah. Like I just, I, when I connect deeply with someone and I see a skillset and I do think that's what, that is a strength of mine is seeing other people's gifts and seeing where we can plug in and where there's potential, I, what I know now is I need to vet that by Ben. I need to vet that by Georgia. It needs to be a team decision now. It's not just like Marie impulsively has fallen in love with this person because I always fall in love with people and I just want to bring them in and be their best friends. And, you know, that's my tendency. I need to take a beat, hold on a second. Let's vet this person and make sure, do we have enough work for this person? You know, can we make a role for them? So usually I start with the person first, but there are, of course, Oh, marketing is a gap right now. So I'm keeping my eyes peeled for someone that could fill that gap for me. So it's a combination of just who in my network is showing up or who in the course is shining as this amazing contributor and I'm like, Ooh, like. Kat has a way with the way she speaks, just participating on office hours. I was like, I want to collaborate with her. Kat was hired directly from as a student to a collaborator. I think that's wonderful. That's one of my favorite ways is to see somebody that's actively doing the thing that you need and then to lift them into the role and then she shared a course of hers in the forum. It was, it was called elevate your. Elevate your online presentations or something like that. So how to be more engaging on zoom, how to present, how to speak. And I was like, Oh, this woman, whenever she speaks, there's so much clarity, she doesn't use filler words. She just has a way and a confidence on camera. I was like, I don't have, could I like take some of that from you? It's amazing. The way that you, that she shows up. And I thought I want Notion Mastery training and even our videos to have that level of quality. What could that look like if I brought her into co-deliver training or to even just actually deliver training on my behalf, maybe I don't even need to be there for, for all of those trainings. What would that look like? So just keeping an open mind and just tuning into where have I been wanting to up the quality? Okay. I see somebody showing up in that way. Let's bring them into the fold. Let's collaborate first and then slowly harass them continuously until they agree to take on a full-time job. I followed that playbook in the past. Actually, I think it's a pretty good way. I'm not, you know, I, I agree. And then like now when I can ask somebody and bring other people in, because I get very enthusiastic, very quickly. And, you know, I know in my heart that sometimes my enthusiasm wanes also. So like, I have to balance that and having like other trusted collaborators that you can go to and get feedback and curb your enthusiasm of it. Which sucks. Cause you're like, no, you don't understand. This is the most exciting thing. And they're like, hold on, simmer down. I'm like, it's difficult. Yeah. Hiring people can't be a hobby. I think that's the, that's the key takeaway for me is that you can't, that isn't a hobby. It is, you're affecting other people. So it's unlike other things that you do. It's something that you have to take back. Well, can I ask you based on, there's obviously been some similarity in our experience there, but are there some takeaways that you've learned? Okay. Now I know this about hiring. This is something that I always do every time. Were there any sort of just general lessons learned that you. The bigger, the ambition, the harder it is and the harder it is. It's like anything, right? Like it's like this iterative approach. And if we don't take the contract to hire approach where we work together for a period of time and make sure that it works, it almost has never worked out. Everything that's worked out best for me has been like, okay, let's do this project. It's going to be fairly small scale. And lately my, for the last couple of years, it's the, I pay people to do discovery engagements, which is if you're a consultant, it's recommended that you do pay discovery engagements. And I've taken like full classes on how to convince your clients to pay you for discovery engagements. And I take the opposite approach. I'm like, if that's a good idea on that side, like it's probably a good idea just to pay people to do discovery engagement. So I will literally hire them and pay their consulting rate to come in and do hourly stuff and see how that works out. And then at the end of that, we get a deliverable. So whatever, whatever that is, their best suggestions and the, you know, or, you know, we, we fix things along the way. And if that works out, then let's do this. And if it doesn't, it's like nobody, nobody loses. Like you haven't, if it just doesn't work out or you just quietly part ways, which has happened more than a few times, that's fine, it's not a bad outcome. And there's no major trauma in anybody's life when we do it that way. And everybody gets paid and you know, we get to collaborate for a period of time and I like that. Yeah. Otherwise we, I kind of also, cause I've gone up and down in the amount of folks that we are collaborating with and trying to find the equilibrium and, you know, it's like you said, can do, is there enough work? Is there enough of this kind of work? Can they actually be happy here? Can we support them? You know, when you're talking about a long-term collaborator, it really gets more and more complex, I think too. So that's been a challenge for sure. Is Notion Mastery going to be like your flagship going forward or do you have plans to break that down? Cause you talked about niching and I'm wondering, you know, like at what points, here's the course that's the, and you know, and this isn't a drag on you, but often mastering is in a course title and it's what does that actually mean to do that? And then the niches are different. There's different verticals and domains and different skill levels. And are you going to divide that up as multiple products or even expand outside of Notion for your, yourself and what you teach? There will probably be like Ben, for example, is working on more of the team based content because just inherently using Notion as a team versus using it as a small business where your whole life and business is integrated are very different use cases, even from first principles, like how would you set up your databases and that sort of thing? So we are definitely in the process of separating that out a little bit and figuring out what is Notion for teams or Notion at work? What does that look like? And then Kat is probably going to be developing our train the trainer programs. How do we actually make people who can go to a company and train a company together? Because we work together, like I'm sure you, you can probably get this. We've had people hire us to build their spaces for them. And it's very difficult to get buy-in if we do the build. So if the person is not participating in the build, they get freaked out and their team members are afraid to break stuff and they just don't use it or they use it wrong or they don't watch the train. Like it's a heavy lift to get a full team on board unless those members are all like super excited and stoked. If they're getting dragged in to learn this new thing, they're like, why wouldn't we just use Google Docs? It's really hard to get buy-in. So what we're finding or what our sort of strong opinion is, do not outsource your build, get someone internally or get a trainer to actually take the time to train up your team. This is a process. It shouldn't be just a weekend thing. And you set up your space and you're good to go. It's a process to get your team onto Notion and using it really effectively. So that's there's a big opportunity there, too, that we're like, OK, could that look like? I think the team dynamics, almost everything we do lately is like, how does this affect teams? Because I think most of us are trying to work on teams and one way or the other. And there's exceptions to that. But I think we're, you know, we're in a very team oriented society as far as our work goes. And you're so absolutely right. Like the CEO edict, OK, we're using Notion now. Stop using Google Docs. Get into Notion on Monday. Marie set it up for you. So just use it. OK, that doesn't work. Nobody will do that. It lasts a week and then they're back in Google Docs or wherever. And there's no so important at an organizational level to get in like the grassroots campaign. What's in it for you? Like, why should I bother? What is this? You know, Google Docs works fine. Here's how we can set up your space. Here's how we can set up your workflows and like identifying the kind of same workflows that work for everybody and how they communicate and that kind of thing is that's huge. And frankly, I think a lot of modern knowledge management is always it's always framed in the person. And there's this organizational knowledge management. And there's probably been a lot of that's why we have so many bad products. There's Microsoft Teams and Jira and, you know, like the full Atlassian suite and Salesforce and all these kind of tools that are built at these monstrous tools for orgs that are like everything for everybody all the time kind of situation. I don't know. I think there's something better for teams out there. I think Notion actually works really great for us as a team. So that makes sense to me. Yeah, I was always impressed by your sort of shared, like how transparent you were with the team and sort of felt like you guys were growing this shared knowledge of together. And I thought it was more transparent that I think a lot of companies are willing to be for some reason. Like keeping stuff stashed. Yeah. Yeah. Or locked. Yeah. God forbid that our other team members have access to those notes or something like that. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I don't even have any personal everything I have is pretty much open to my team. I don't open it to the world, but I'll open it to my team like that sort of situation. So how is how has the actual people taking your course affected the course over time? How have they driven change and feedback from them? It sounds like a lot considering you're hiring folks out of your course to actually help continue the course. But yeah. Yeah. And I've hired, you know, three, four people in different ways, contract and otherwise, for sure. So I've had people go in and edit. I've had people come up with solve ideas and stuff like that. So hugely for sure. And I think part of that is partly being a people pleaser, maybe a bit of perfectionist, just like I'm a quick start, like I launch stuff really quickly. But I also do have this. I do want this to be a super high quality product. I care because also when you have 1,700 people in there, like that's the biggest product, the biggest audience I've had for a product that I've made in terms of, you know, online courses and stuff to some people, it might not be that big a deal. But I'm like, holy crap, that's 1,700 people that paid me that money for that. I need to show up. I need to make sure that they feel like they got what they paid for. And so it really matters to me. So people are stuck and they're filling out stuff that says, hey, I was really confused by X or, you know, I feel like this was missing X. I'm like, oh, OK, better go back and either add that or rethink that. And that's really important to me. So getting good at accepting feedback, I think when you're a teacher and getting good, getting good at discerning, is this just this one person's weird edge case or is this actually a problem on a bigger scale? Because not everybody that has a problem with your content is telling you as well. So discerning that is a whole process, too. And then how do you incentivize people to give you feedback and not just, oh, be disappointed and then peace out? It really does matter to us. So in the beginning, I didn't have any follow up sequences through email. There was nothing that was sort of systemized in that way to collect that feedback. So it took a while to get all the processes in place. And that's what having Georgia, you know, my ops person in place to do that was huge. So now we have even just a simple check in form, I think, that goes out after six weeks. That's, hey, what's challenging you with the course right now? How can we make your experience better? Just anything goes. And then what's a win that you had this week? It doesn't even have to be course related. Just how can we celebrate with you? And strangely enough, those simple questions have been a goldmine for even just, oh, OK, ideas for improving content, realizing where there's gaps and that sort of thing. So that's it's super important to me that the course does deliver on its promise and that it feels like an industry standard course. I don't think it's there yet, but that's where I want to move with it and make it freaking excellent. My last question is pricing and what's your decision making in terms of pricing? And I think one of the interesting things with your course pricing is when it's priced, I think you've you know, it's not inexpensive and it's not cost prohibitive. And it really depends on how you're using it, if it's worth it to you. So I think that that pricing gives a good amount of buy in. But then you also don't make a it's not like a buy once, get it forever. And it's also not a subscription, which I thought was interesting. And I don't think I've seen that happen a lot where it's like a non-recurring annual fee to participate. Well, I think part of that, too, is the course still feels like it's in progress, like we're still evolving and iterating on this new version. So we've never actually expired anyone. So even though it's like the course, get it for 12 months, we've actually never kicked anybody out. So anyone who even signed up two years ago still has access to all the new materials. And some of the early people wouldn't have even had office hours. So the fact that, you know, some people would have paid 300 bucks for the course and two years later, I think we did one hundred and twenty eight live events last year. So even though it's technically a self-study, there are so many different live events that we put on to to make sure that people can get what they need. So in the beginning, it was what, two to ninety seven. I didn't know just through through a random number out there. I'm like, are people willing to pay this? And I think after a hundred people, I was like, OK, let's increase it to three hundred. OK, it didn't there was no change in people signing up. OK, let's add another hundred bucks. No change at all in the number of people that were signing up. I thought, OK, it was clearly underpriced at some point. And we're also making improvements. Right. So to me, it's, you know, certainly an art to know how to price things and even comparing to similar quality of courses. You know, what is another X number of sessions and the type of delivery model and just sort of comparing what are people used to paying in these different industries for software, that sort of thing? It feels like a intuitive, chaotic guess. I've had people tell me I can't afford this. It's way too overpriced. And I've had people be like, this is ridiculous value and you definitely need to increase the price. You know, to some people, it's going to be underpriced to some people. It's not quite there. So I'm sure once the new curriculum is finished, we'll probably change up our pricing model again. It's always a good time to reevaluate, too, when you have a major update and see what the what the market will be. I also think that there's the idea that you can provide discounts. You can always provide discounts, but it's hard to charge people more. You know what I mean? If you have a course and it's X dollars, you can't be like for you, it's going to be several hundred dollars more than that. Right. Where the other way is people will generally appreciate it and you can have systems like we do purchase Power Parity to where. Yeah, Parity Bar. Yeah. We're globally. We know we don't use anything sensible like Parity Bar. We built a bespoke system just for us. I don't think Parity Bar existed when we made it, but it's great. Like it just picks up where you are and gives you a discount based on global purchasing power. And I think that kind of thing is great. And, you know, like student programs and all that. And you can always do that. But we've tried, you know, if you're an enterprise, we're going to charge you more. And, you know, if you want team features and I've seen that around, I've never been very happy with it. Pricing is very difficult. I like that you brought up the parity thing, too, because I've always sort of had this charge enough to be generous. Being generous is an important part. Like I love being able to for someone who's been saving for a while and, you know, sends a really lovely reply to an email newsletter. I've been like, hey, I know that you've been this is you've had your eye on it and money's tight. And here's here's a copy of the course or whatever. Like I've definitely given the course out for free to people or to, you know, given out scholarships and parity pricing. So that's important. But that also means we still need to keep the lights on and pay the team. So finding that balance that you can build that generosity into your pricing, I think, is pretty, pretty cool. Yeah, definitely. Marie, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I appreciate your course on a material level because it's helped us and we like as an organization have been using it to just come up our own game. And so that's a lot of fun. And I know it's helping a lot of people manage the chaos that our lives are in this digital age. Appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you so much for hanging out and chatting with me. Thank you for great questions. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey, thanks for having me on. I'm excited about this. Yeah, I'm really stoked to talk to you. We have a lot in common. You've inspired my business from years ago. I think we've been chatting since 2014 or 15 and we have a kind of similar business models and do a lot of the similar work and are stoked by some of the same activities at the core of it for me, and I know it's similar for you. It's, it's first and foremost, like being a web developer is something that I still get such a kick out of. And this job allows me to do that in a way that I get to control and that's fantastic. I want to kick it off though, and ask you, how do you approach learning something new and you sit down to do something technical, complex that you haven't done before. What's your learning approach? Yeah. So my approach is a bit different than the people that take my courses, which is funny, but like the type of person that's taking my course is someone who wants like a linear path and to be sat down and to be shown everything for. So for me, when there's not necessarily a course out there or just my learning approaches, I sort of just try to like binge information on the topic. So whether that's watching all the conference talks, like you can learn a lot by throwing on a YouTube conference talk, you skip the first five minutes, you put it on 2x and just blitz through that thing. You watch three or four of those. And I always talk about like surface area of a topic, really good for understanding like what it does, like what it covers, what it doesn't cover, how to use it, and then I'll usually blitz through the docs, look at examples, and then just get into building three or four different things with a specific tech. It's sort of my hands-on approach to getting dirty and learning something. You find it's technology mostly that you're doing that? Or do you have other areas where you, of interest that you're pursuing? All the time with everything. Like last year I put in, we have a cottage up north, it's unlimited water. You can pump, so I put in spring, a huge sprinkler system. And like, I just went, I went all in. I watched all the YouTube videos. I read all the things I went down the rabbit hole, learn all the math of pressure and flow, those things are trade-offs and like, I just, I went all in on it and I know literally everything you need to know about sprinkler irrigation. And now I'm done and onto the next thing. And like my entire life is boat engines, carburetors, fixing ATVs, like all. I just go nuts on a certain topic. I learn it really well. And then to move on to the next thing. And I don't abandon those things, but I just know how to do those things now. And then I go deep. I do a deep dive on something else. And it's funny. You're not trying to, I've seen that with the ATVs in particular. I'm always like, when you, or you buy the toy cars for the kids and then soup them up, right, and go and they're broken. So you can pick them up for cheap and then go ahead and fix them. And I think that is so fun. It looks so interesting. It's not like you're going to do that for a living. I mean, no, but no, I probably wouldn't. I wouldn't, I did make quite a bit of cash flipping bikes when I was in university and up until about five years ago, which was really fun for me. Cause I like working on my hands and it's business, but it's also learning how things work. But that's not my, I just do that because I enjoy getting into something new. So, and I assume it's different and probably the same when you have, you know, some sort of new course topic or you found something that you think you want to teach, what's your research project process for something like that? Is it different than how you would approach learning something for personal? It's pretty similar. Like just read through absolutely everything, build four or five things. Um, like I never want to be the guy teaching something who just made a to-do list and teach us how to do that. Like you have to know more than that. You have to know like more surface area. You have to actually hit the bumps and issues that people run into. Otherwise your course is just too like, it's too thin. It's okay. Yeah. I too can do the hello world on something, but what about real projects? Like what about real issues that we all run into? You know, you don't cover that. So I always try to make at least three or four things in the specific tech that I'm doing, um, of, of different sizes, but of like different, like areas that you hit, like maybe is heavy on data. Maybe another one is heavy on permissions and authentication. And maybe another is big on the integrations with another API. Right. And then I usually just have a feeling of, okay, I feel pretty confident that I would be able to build something in this. And then you sort of reverse engineer that saying, okay, what are the things you hit, what are the things you need to learn? Um, and then what can you build in a course or how do you teach that in many lessons, um, to cover all of those things? So people get their, uh, people are get their money's worth and they're able to learn what it is you need to learn on that tech. Are you using any sort of kind of learning design framework or is it something you've built up over the years for yourself as you've taught and explored that space? Yeah, I use like mind mapping software and usually what I'll do when I'm at a point where I'm like, okay, I know the tech, what do I need to teach people? I'll just do a, like a brain dump of all the things that need to be covered. And then that will slowly morph its way into a, a mind mapping software. So you have one, one major topic, and then there might be a couple of branches off of that, right? And then by the time I'm done, I'll have all of the topics that you need to learn and all the subtopics that need to learn. And I can then turn that into, uh, an actual course. So I don't have any set framework. It's just kind of in my brain that I know how to approach. I know in the past, you've talked about like live teaching and actually teaching people more of a classroom setting. It has been very important. Is that something you still do? I know times have been weird in person, but is that still important part of your process? I haven't done that in a while. I did do quite before COVID I, I still did, I don't know, three or four workshops per year, but before that I was doing for years, I did bootcamps and evening classes and like, I feel like I got a really good handle on how people learn and how people hit issues just because of the, that in-person energy you get from people where you explain something and it bombs, or you explain something and there's excitement in the air, you know, and I feel like I have it pretty dialed in, um, based on that in-person feedback. So I was, I'm very happy about that. And I still do really enjoy doing like workshops and stuff. I get tons of requests to do it. It's, it's kind of hard now. I've got three young kids and I did a lot of that before I had any kids. So I don't do it as much anymore. Do you do any, have you done any kind of zoom live stuff or that sort of workshopping? I just haven't, I've had a lot of people ask about that and I just, I don't know that I could like, a, I don't want to come up with the content. If I have a workshop, like usually what I'll do is I'll make a workshop and I'll do that many times over. Right. But I don't have any workshops that are up to date right now because of COVID. And then I've had a couple of requests for zoom, but just hasn't been something like, eh, I don't really know that I enjoy teaching that in person over zoom. It's maybe something I should try, but it's just, there's only so much time in the day and I think my time is better spent making courses. And well, the energy is different too. I think a live workshop where you're in the person and you know, you talked about the benefit for you as being able to feel the energy in the room and you don't get the same sort of experience on zoom. It's there, but it's not the same. Yeah, I agree. So when somebody comes to, you've got how many courses are you up to? Oh, I don't know. Probably over 13, something like that. A dozen courses. And they're focused on web developers, I think almost exclusively. What are people trying to achieve? What are the learners? What's the big themes that people are trying to achieve when they encounter your courses? Yeah, it's kind of a mix. A big portion of my learners are people who they're at a job and that job needs them to learn this tech. The big one is Express. Tons of company, like Express is not the new hot thing, but I have a node course that covers all of Express and learns how to do it. And that's still very popular in the, like we have employees and we need to skill them up on this tech, take Wes's course and you'll be up to speed really quickly. So that's, that's a big one is that there's employees in a company need to be skilled up on their existing, or they're thinking about picking up a new stack and they need to learn a new, some new tech. Maybe they're thinking, okay, maybe we should pick up react for our project. So that's a big one. And then the other part of it is, and I'm not sure what the breakdown is, but it's people who are looking to improve their skillset so that they can get a better job in their current job, things like that, or just keep up to date and the tech that's changing all the time. Cause you know that, right? You know that one of the big drivers, and I assume that like for the Express course, you're getting companies that are buying multiple seats for their teams at that point. Do you take that into consideration when you sit down to design a course? Like this is going to be something that teams will be able to use, or this will be something that's, you know, for a beginner developer, how do you kind of divide that up and think about the audience before you even make the course? I don't know that I do that. I basically just say, this is tech that I use and I believe in and use to build my own stuff. I think people want to learn how to use it. So people will probably pay me to learn how, how to do that. Or in the case of the free courses, this is the courses. So this is something they need to learn. So that's part of it. And then there's also like stuff like Flexbox, grid, JavaScript, that just literally everybody needs to know how to learn. Right. Like that was a big thing with my Flexbox course when that came out and grid course when it came out, is that like, there's not a single dev on earth that doesn't need to learn this because it's brand new. Right. So that's a really good one for me as well. Cause it's very, very wide casting net there. It's new and it's good too. And that's the thing, right? Like with Flexbox, while this is something that you really should know, not just that you could know it, this is something that you probably want to know if you're doing web development at all. It's true. All developers are going to be able to use that. It's not just like this niche part of CSS. That's like print styles or something funny like that. What, what goes into the decision process? Cause you, and I think it's awesome that you release free content and give people, you know, this opportunity to learn without having to pay for it. And that's very inclusive and gives us just opportunity that people might not otherwise have. But what's the calculus for you? Like, how do you decide what's going to be free and what's going to be paid and when you're going to go big or when it's going to be something contained that you can offer for free? I think I'll do a, if something is, if something is like good to everybody, it's a wide casting net, Flexbox grid, JavaScript 30, like those are all things that I heard from my students. Like I need to learn these things. Where do I go to learn them? That's good for me. It's good for business. People take the course, they like it. Some of those people will end up buying a paid course. And then it's also just good for the general humanity of being able to put stuff out there. That's how I got started blogging and stuff. It's being able to put it out there for really anybody. It's like without getting too cheesy because this is a business, but like it's also really cool to, to see people being like, Hey, I took your courses and thank you so much. I was able to get my first job as a web developer, or I was able to get like a $20,000 increase in my salary. Like that means a lot to me as well, hearing those stories. So those stories seem like a great way to answer this question, but how do you know when somebody succeeded, like somebody's taking your course and what are the kind of the metrics for success that you see in the learners that you're helping? Yeah, I think it just enthusiasm of people recommending it to their friends. Obviously there's metrics of how many people are signing up and taking the course and getting through all the videos and stuff like that. I don't pay too much attention to that, but it's basically just do these things spread without me having to really hammer them and have funnels and CEO and all that stuff, right? If it's those things are important, but if spread around really well, then, then I know I've succeeded. And most of my courses do, I've got a little one on Markdown that like almost nobody will ever tweet about it or sign up for it, right? Like it's just a, and like Markdown is good. And I made it really quickly because I love Markdown, but it's not something that is going to change someone's life. Like being able to level up your CSS. Do you cross-reference those? So if you created something small in Markdown that you're giving out, does this reference to another courses where it might be useful? Sometimes I'll say, Hey, if you want to know more about this, the big one for me is I have a command line because everybody, every course I do, Hey, how did you get that prompt? What font is that? How did you, what's that theme? How did you do that? Cool. Auto-complete like all of those questions. And as much of a temptation is to go down those rabbit holes as you're, you're teaching it, you got to stay on track of what you're actually trying to accomplish. So it's really nice to be like skipping over this because draw the rest of the owl type of thing. I'm just saying, Hey, if you want to know how I got this cool prompt, there's actually a free course on that. And it's nice to be able to push them, but I don't like clip videos together to make full courses. It's usually just start to link, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can link it in the notes basically and tell people where to go. I think that's actually something cool. Speaking of notes. And I noticed you, you started to do this recently where you're taking your paid course and you've created notes, I assume from learners and yourself, and you're actually publishing those and giving those away. And I thought that was really interesting. I was wondering what kind of prompted that. Yeah. I, my beginner JavaScript course, that's a paid course. I like, yeah, it's the same thing. It's twofold. So I had somebody the entire course and I had them transcribed cause I need captions and things like that. And then I took those transcriptions and I had a technical writer make them into actual text notes. And that was huge. It was very expensive for me to get done. And then I just gave it away for free on my thing. And again, it's the same thing. A it's good for business. It shows up in search engines. People find it, people want it, but B also sometimes people don't like video and they want text, a text version of that. Right. So I thought I might as well just give that away for free. And then there's also something nice about being able to give literally how to learn JavaScript away entirely for free. I think it's pretty good content, you know, something nice about that as well. And like, I remember one time I, I was, I got mad that somebody was like stealing my course and giving it away for free. And I got so much pushback from people being like, no, like you, if people want to steal it, they should be able to steal it because they're learning JavaScript and they're trying to better their life. And I was like, kind of, but also like it's my business, you know, and that's what makes me feel better about trying to take down stolen courses, being like. If you do really want to learn for free, Hey here, I've paid somebody to put it into text or, Hey, look, I've got six free courses you can, you can take as well. So I don't know. It's just, it's a delicate balance there. You don't want to be the capitalistic guy. That's trying to just milk money out of this thing. Cause like I started from a passion of people learning to learn this stuff. Right. Yeah. And well, my, my approach and we've obviously, I think suffered from some of that too, where they're trying to do it. And there's like sites, pay sites in Russia where you can go and they charge to access the course and there's literally nothing we can do. And it's like, that's going to exist where I fight it. It's where somebody will just rip the course and then post it to YouTube. And my problem with that is like the people watching it don't necessarily know that it's stolen. Right. So they aren't bad actors where people, if they're going to a pirate site or whatever, it's, you're not really a customer anyway. But you know, if it's, if somebody is posting it just in full form on YouTube, those are the ones that I had to write a script that was the, the YouTube a-holes DMCA. Yeah. I've got one of those as well. Cause Google makes you do, Oh my gosh. It's like a big spreadsheet you have to generate. And I just made a thing. I was like, boop, I have the exact same 20. I had to write it twice. Cause I lost one in a computer migration. So I've written that script a couple of times, but it's handy. And I mean, you have to protect your copyright. Otherwise copyright is useless. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't, then at the end of the day, that is the norm and people basically have permission to take it. And I'll also say that like a majority of the web development community is extremely supportive and extremely cool. And that's like such a good thing. Our communities that people say, Hey, yeah, Wes is me. It probably has something to do with the fact that I actually do give a lot of stuff out for free. And people are willing to stick their neck out for me when something like that does happen. One of the things that I think is interesting about your approach in general is your examples. And JavaScript 30 is one of my favorites that I'll point people to and go, look at that. You, if you want to know if you're interested in JavaScript or you've gone to free code camp and learned a little bit, go there because here's these great examples. And I was wondering, like, how do you decide or what kind of drives the choices in what you create in your courses? Yeah, it has to be something that is real world enough. Enough is important there, I think, right? Like, not exactly because real world is maybe boring and repetitive, but. Real world is 90% edge cases. And like that, that's something that I have a hard time balancing sometimes is that do you go down the rabbit hole and write three times the code to hit that one edge case, or do you just leave it, you know, so like real, yeah, real world enough is very important. So that's one thing. And second, it's, it has to be fun. Like we've all console logged our brains out and done 99 bottles of beer on the wall and what's the foobar baz with the, what's the Fizzbuzz. Fizzbuzz, Fizzbuzz, yeah, we've all done those and those are great, but like usually get into coding, not because they want to loop over a list of things, want to learn how to loop over something when they have an array of stats that are up for adoption, or they want to be able to take in input from the user because a lot of people are saying like, oh, I would love to learn how to code because I have an idea for something or I would really like it, so all of my examples are stuff that are like, okay, I've had to do auto-completion before, or I've had to click a, click a checkbox, hold down shift, click another one, and the checkboxes between those two things are for you, right? Or I've needed something to scroll when you log in, or I've needed to persist something to local storage. And then there's like another bunch of fun stuff, which is like, how do you access the webcam and manipulate it? Or how do you change the voice of somebody's input? Or how do you visualize audio, right? There's a lot to that. So I want people to be able to look at my course and be like, I need that. I like, I need to learn how to do that. And also I want to have fun with it. And it's kind of funny because sometimes you see people that have implemented stuff on their projects and they say, I had to go back to JavaScript 30 and look at the nav example that we did. Cause that's exactly what we wanted to do. And I'm glad that you had a little example like that. Have you had anything unexpected come out of a student that's taken your course and they've made something and shared it with you that was surprising? Yeah. We had a, someone on the podcast who built a website and he ended up getting the attention of Kanye West or something like that. That was pretty funny. You can listen to the podcast on that. Someone sold a startup that was based on one of my code. And I thought that was pretty cool. I totally forget what it is. It wasn't like a major like Uber or something like that, but they got paid from something that they learned in my course. So I thought that was neat. I think that's just like the potentiality of what people can create if they learn these skills is effectively the, you know, scope of the internet, right? Like it's only, there's the skill that they'd need to learn to do the thing. But then once they have these skills, the things that they can do is just this amazing, whatever, right? Like, I don't know. I can't predict what you will build. Yeah. Oh, you see it like people I taught eight years ago in, in the class where they were working construction or being a server, they are now senior developers at Shopify, they're now very established careers. And in many cases are much better developers than I am. And it's amazing to see that all they needed was just like a little bit of a kick in the butt and to learn the basics. And then they had the aptitude to be able to just continue that on for eight years in a row, and now they are in an entirely different place, not to say that construction or server is a bad thing, but they just wanted to change out of that industry. Yeah. That was their goal, right? Like they, they had reached whatever ceiling or plateau and that avenue of their life, and they had a different goal and now they've found success. And frankly, I can understand why people would want to get into software where we can work remote and the salary is incredibly high on a lot of cases and that sort of stuff. So it's a good career and if you're into it, it makes it a nice transition. So you talked about real world enough and the idea of fun. And I'm wondering, where do you bridge the gap between fun and business, right? Because, I mean, there are people out there that are strictly looking to get into code to, you know, maybe as a hobby or for fun or whatever. But there is, you know, the transition from having fun and doing this and kind of the pub bits of this career. And then there's the business aspect of it. And is that something you even consider at all? Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Like it has to everything that we build has to be something that I would actually use myself or implement in myself. Like a lot of my courses, I'll say, hey, this is actually exactly how I do it on this part of my website. Or this is the thing I only am approaching it this way because I actually ran into that issue and show that. So I totally agree. Nobody likes like myself has to be fun for people to learn and to be engaged. Otherwise you give up. If it's too simple, people get bored. If it's too hard, people give up because it's like they hit bugs or whatever. Yeah, you just feel dumb and want to go do something else. Watch Netflix. Exactly. Yeah, it's a delicate balance between that. I don't necessarily know if I have a how I can tell you how do I bridge that. But it's certainly something that's always top of mind for me. I think the definition of fun is interesting for one thing. And I don't think fun means cute necessarily. It can be right. Like you can make something that's whimsical and cute. But like having fun to me, like if I'm sitting down with a database problem that's actually kind of challenging, but within my grasp and then I finally solve it, I probably had fun that day versus like doing something where it's fun and kind of the candy crush kind of kind of idea of fun, I guess. Yeah, I think what I love to see is people take what they build on my courses and they say, I see how I could make it work for my thing. And sometimes you see like someone to be somebody sent me the other day a website of they manage a whole bunch of hockey teams and they have tournaments and those those teams are relational to the tournaments and there's orders and arrays. There's players in those teams and they sent it to me. And it's funny because it looked exactly like what we built in the course, but it was entirely different in terms of the data set and the structure and all the logic as to how it was displayed. I was like that that to me, that's a success because someone says, I'm learning to code because I need to build this website for hockey teams. But and that was what we built was close enough. And I was able to sort of just turn my eyes over to what it is that I wanted to build and take it from there. So it's kind of cool to see as people, they either finish the course and then they start to build out on their own or they're three quarters of the way through the course and they start to say, OK, I think I got it. I'm going to start building my own thing and take the rest of the course, but apply it to what it is my goal is. Do you think completion rates are important in terms of courses or like you just said, like if somebody gets what they need out of it, is that really what? Yeah, yeah. We talked about that on the podcast the other day. Sometimes somebody gets what they need out of it. They say, I just really needed to know this one thing about how you manage databases or how you populate the GraphQL API. To me, that was worth the cost of admission and I'm done. But then at another point, yeah, that's it's worth finishing it entirely because that what good developers do, that's what people who are good at things in life, they can see it through because that last 10 percent is incredibly difficult in any project. And anyone that's able to push through that is that's just a good personality trait, in my opinion. Finishing is a superpower. I think a lot of people don't and it can set you apart if you are able to take something from start to finish, particularly in this career, because a lot of people aren't able to do that. And just showing up and doing the work until it's done is something to be said. Absolutely. Totally agree. How do you maintain your courses over time? Because it's kind of a struggle because technology moves. And I assume it's some combination of picking technologies that aren't moving super fast maybe. Or how do you maintain them over time? Yeah, I'll definitely pick a tech is either a standard and can be updated. Like CSS Grid, a perfect example, CSS Grid is not going to change except they're going to add stuff onto it. Subgrid is a good example. Easy. Just add a couple more videos. Hey, everybody, since this last was recorded, we have new features. Let me show you how you use them. Right. Let me show you the problem that we hit in this one thing. Now we can fix that in that one. So that's really easy if it's pinned to a piece of tech. It's a little harder when it's when it's moving parts. So I'll usually talk to if I'm using a library, I'll talk to whoever builds that library and say, hey, it's your plan. Like Keystone is a really good example is I was started building it on Keystone five and they said, hey, just heads up, we are doing a major to this type of thing. So we'll let you build it on the next version of it. And that was a good choice by me because otherwise the entire course would have been out of date. Right. So there's that. And then the other thing is sometimes you just got to rerecord it or deprecate the thing because it's just it's just too far out from what people are using this day. And that's that's just the name of the game, I guess. I would assume with something like React, it's obviously worth rerecording. Right. If you had your class based components and now you want to do hooks and all the good stuff that's in modern React. So that makes it worth it. And sometimes it's just you let people know, hey, this is old. You might still get some value out of it. But yeah, like my Redux course, I've deprecated it. You can still take it because that's the other thing is that people think, OK, well, this tech is out for a month, really the rest of it is garbage. But then you get other people being like, oh, our our company is actually built on the older version of it and our devs still need to learn that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So like you still got to keep it around for people who want to learn that. I find that sometimes really frustrating as if you.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"they don't update a website for a year and a half, even finding docs for the old version is sometimes really, really tricky. Oh yeah, because they just blow them out of the water instead of having some sort of versioning scheme and it isn't even valid anymore. I think it's interesting because you talk about the Redux and Dan Abramov, like when Redux was created, recorded an egghead course that's had like hundreds of thousands of people have watched this thing. And people are like, oh, and I'll get comments to this day where it's, oh, this is out of date. And I'm like, wow, you really missed the point where Dan Abramov is showing you how to build Redux and you're complaining that the technology is out of date. And I'm like, you can still learn something from, I don't think sort by new is necessarily the best way to pick the best and most useful learning content on the internet. And I think that's kind of something that I've noticed people tend to do. They want the new, when was this updated? Was this updated last week? If not, then it's bad. It's totally true. When I redid my blog, I was so tempted to take the published dates off because as soon as somebody sees that something two years old, they click out of it, right? But people get also mad when there's no published dates. So I didn't do that, but it's definitely something that, and it's valid at some point because we've all been burned by going down a rabbit hole and realizing, oh, this thing is, this is totally out of date or the UI doesn't look like this anymore, you know? So you've built your own platform. And when you started, I assume there wasn't such a choice, but why not use something like a teachable or Podia or something to do your thing? When I started, there was nothing like that out there. I guess some people were using Gumroad and then just downloading zips. That's actually how mine started as well. It was just a zip of video files and you had to play them yourself, which is hilarious because that would never be okay to this day. Now it's a whole viewing experience. And then I just love having the ability to have full control over the purchasing and the viewing experience and everything like that, because I don't know, you get the whole runaround. Hey, it'd be great if we added this company. Oh yeah, let me put that on our list. You never add that, you know? And then the best example is I had a problem where we had this parody purchasing power where I would get emails every day from someone who lived in India or whatever. And they said, hey, we don't make as much money as you do in North America or Europe. Can I get a discount? And it was really frustrating because absolutely, I want everybody to be able to afford these things and whatnot, I'm happy to do it, but I just can't emotionally do that every single day, figure out, okay, what's fair to you? So I rolled out parody purchasing power on the website. So if you visit it from a country where purchasing power is less than your standard big countries like Canada, United States, a lot of the European countries. And I was just like, okay, this is really easy for me to just check the country, restrict purchasing, buy coupons by which country they're on. And I was like, I never would have been able to do that if I was on one of these platforms. And of course they rolled it out eventually, but that was three or four years after I had implemented it. I don't think it's even really widespread, to be honest. I think Stripe is rolling it out on their own checkout, which is pretty cool. But yeah, it's just, you probably know this as well as being able to have full control over it. And also that's my baby, that's the thing that I work on. That's like my huge production application that has a lot in it. And if you wouldn't want to take a course for me, if I was the guy who just uses a software as a service or strings together 14 press plugins together, right? Like you want to see me actually building real software, is running a business that's paying people salaries. And that's, I also very much enjoy working on it as well. So there's something to be said for the developer who wants. Yeah, I mean, part of it has to be because you can. And I think that's an important thing to know, right? Like you are able to do that. And if you are able, then that's great. And for some folks, they can't kind of invent their own platform. Then those services are awesome, serve a purpose. But for you, you're able to build this thing that you call the boss monster. That's the name of your course platform. And if people want to like hear, you've done a couple episodes of Syntax FM, number 442 came out recently. And you and Scott get into how both of you approach your platform. So that's, we're not going to get into that depth. It's like a full hour of y'all just going full ham on how you do this. But how do you describe boss monster, your course platform? How do you describe that? What's the kind of the elevator pitch of your platform? So it's a node application that does, I think three or four major things. It does the landing pages. I call them marketing sites for all of my courses. Every course I do has its own domain name. So it powers all that. It powers the whole purchasing checkout experience. So that's like the main thing. Then there's a whole API behind that I can use for the administrative dashboard. So, and customers and refunds and changing names and whatnot. There's that's a whole Next.js application that's used for administrating all the data on it. Then there is the actual course viewing experience. So I want to view my courses. I want to see my receipts. I want to, I bought a team license. I want to send it to my team member. I'm an affiliate. I want to see how much money I've made this month. I want to actually watch the course. I want to click through the videos. I want to see exactly where I am in the videos. My progress is tracked, all that good stuff. So that's the biggest part of it probably. And then there's just a bunch of reporting in the note app as well. And things for taxes and when I have to remit to the government here, all that good stuff as well. Yeah, you got to automate that. Otherwise, just like tears of blood. Yeah, yeah, no kidding. That's the least favorite thing I could possibly think of doing. I love to automate that stuff. My taxes. Yeah, yeah. Is there anything that, you know, like, I assume some things have changed over the years because you've been doing this for a while now, but what stayed the same? What is the core that just hasn't really needed to move that you haven't felt the need to update or move on to something newer and better? Probably the funny thing is that the marketing sites for each course is a single page and that is server rendered. It's done in, it was in Jade for the longest time. It only got moved to Pug six months ago. It's styled with style and it's still, there's a little, maybe not. There might be a little bit of jQuery in there. There's a little bit of font awesome. That's just, and that will probably eventually, like the checkout experience needs to be totally rewritten into like a more dynamic app so we can accept more payment methods. But the actual, just like HTML rendered, there's literally nothing wrong with that. And I would see no benefit in updating that to React or Next or anything like that. Yeah, cause they don't, the marketing sites aren't also the delivery sites. The experience, it goes to the platform site where they're then inside of a platform and they have access to all of the courses that they purchase from you. Exactly, like that, the delivery is a React app because you need to click around and view the whole thing. But the actual marketing website is just a page and I could move that to some sort of static site generator but there's literally no use that, there's no benefit to that, you know? Like that's not gonna help my users, it's not gonna make me more money and it works really well. How do you balance this idea of actually working on your platform and creating new learning material? It sounds like the platform actually feeds learning material cause you can keep it real because you're still using the air quotes, real developer, whatever that might be. And you know, like what's the balance and like how do you decide what to do on a given day? It's just, if I'm working on a course, I'm working on a course and then like in between courses, I'll get a bunch of time to pushing through a bunch of stuff. Like the last couple of weeks, we did a big push to roll out the new viewing experience. It had a whole bunch of updates, it had notes and stuff like that. So it's pretty much just like, I don't call them sprints, but all right, I'm done that course. Now I'm gonna work on these couple of features that I wanted to do that. And I also have another guy who helps me on the course now, course platform as well now. And that's really nice because if there's bugs that pop up or features that I don't necessarily have time for, it's nice to be able to have those being worked on while I don't have to be distracted from actually working on the courses. For a long time, it was just you and then you brought on people and now you say we, when we're talking about your platform. And I was wondering what that transition was like for you to go from just being fully solo to like having people help and be able to convey information. So it's like me, AJ, AJ does the support. So if you hit a syntax error or anything like that, and then he also works on the course platform. So that works out really well. And then there is Whitney, she's my assistant. She does all of the administrative stuff, accounting and expenses and emails and protecting me from getting more than 300 emails a day. So it's been pretty good. Like I never wanted to be, I've like actively gone against becoming a big thing. You know, like I don't want tons of employees and meetings and all that stuff. Like I just wanna sit at my computer, hack on this thing, make cool courses and sell them. You know, like that's my dream. And I feel like I've got there. But at a certain point, things get hectic and you do need some help. So I feel like I have a pretty good balance between people helping me, but those people really know what I want. And we don't have to chat too much. And like we all- I would expect it didn't start that way though, right? Like how did you actually- Yeah. Go from not having anybody helping you to having people help you? Like how do you take those processes that are like all in your head or wherever you store them and then deliver them and get other people to understand? So I have them for the administrative, that's the biggest one. Because it's just, I have all these processes for what happens if somebody wants to upgrade their course or what happens if somebody is on a team and they give them the course and then they quit in two days. You know, there's all these things that come up and those are called standard operating procedures. And literally anytime something comes up twice, you take 10 minutes of your day, you write up a SOP for it, and then you have a way to approach it. And then like other things, like they sort of just know my voice and how I'd approach it. They know I'm very kind. So they have the ability just to give a free course to somebody if something happened or they bought the wrong one or whatever, you know? So there's that. And then also the nice thing about a developer who works with me is that he's taken all of my courses and literally knows how I write code because he's taken every single one of my courses. He was able to get pretty comfortable in the stack pretty quickly because it's the same as my Node course. So you and Scott Tulinski record a podcast called Syntex FM and it's amazing. You have stuck with it. Y'all have stuck with it for just the extent of the time that it just is mind-boggling to me. And I'm wondering, like how has the podcasting kind of played into it? Or how does that fit into your courses and just your job and work in general? The podcast was awesome. We just started it as, it's fun to chit-chat. Like me, you, Scott, and Josh had a mastermind and we really like just talk and shop. So, and then like he was already doing a lot of YouTube. I was already doing a lot of YouTube. So we're like, oh, let's try a podcast, you know? And nice thing about it is that we both had like pretty sizable audience for it. So we didn't have to go through that initial slog, 20 listeners a week, you know? Like we really hit the, and I always tell people that. I'm like, I think it's hard to start a podcast when you don't have an audience somewhere else. So we hit the ground running. We've been doing it for a long time and we just use it as a way to, like we advertise our courses at the very end. It's the last thing we do in the podcast called shameless plugs. And then it's also just like a great way to stay up to date on all the new tech because people ask us about all kinds of stuff and we got to do our research and we got to try this stuff and whatnot. So it's been good. And then also it's been like, it's been excellent for selling courses, good advertising. And it's also like, we've got sponsors and the sponsors pay us money to be on the podcast. So that makes money for us as well. So it's not like this like thing where, oh, let's just keep doing it because it's selling courses. But like the podcast itself is a business because there's advertisers that want to get on there. Yeah, it's great. And it's also like the, just the sticks of it has been just impressive because it is difficult to stick with something like that continuously over time. It's been the most consistent thing I've done in my entire life, I think. It's nuts. Like we've done two episodes a week for four years and it would just show up every Monday morning and we say, hey, what's up? And then we just, we do a little bit of work and then we just start hit record and go for it, you know? And we're in a pretty good flow of it right now. Yeah, and there's some, the catalog, and you've mentioned it a few times since we've been talking. I'll go listen to the podcast. I'll go, you know, now you can say that because you have this catalog and you can refer to it. And so you have a resource also and like a kind of an ankle thing where your children can one day go learn about their dad and at least a side of. It's nice to have a podcast where, like people ask me all the time, what's your core stack? And like we did one four years ago and now we just updated it last week because people ask all the time and it's nice to be able to point people to it. And we did another one on like sort of management as just a resource that people can point their family to. You know, like how do you explain two-factor auth to your mom or something like that? And now we made it and it's nice to be like, hey, go listen to this. Even if you don't, like wanna learn about web development, that one is just specifically about how do you manage your passwords? So beyond just making cool courses and getting to do what you want, do you have any kind of audacious goals as a developer or a teacher? I don't know. I think, like I'm at where I wanna be and I'm really enjoying it. And it's paying the bills. So I'm just gonna keep doing it. I'm very in tune with becoming burned out. And I'm very careful with taking on too much or getting anywhere. And oh yeah, like part of me is, oh man, I got this, I have this huge big email list. I've got this course platform. Like maybe I could do what you do and just run that for somebody else, you know? And sell a whole bunch of course. And part of me is like, yeah, I kinda wanna do that. But then the other part of me is like, I also just enjoy what I'm doing right now as well. So that's kinda like in the maybe down the road. But past that, it's just keep teaching people cool tech. Keep doing the podcast. Keep building cool stuff. And do that as long as you enjoy it. Well, you talked about that. And this stems from, and I just gotta tell the story real quick since we're chatting. So I was at a conference and we're sitting there and Egghead produces courses. And we have a lot of courses. And when you make an Egghead course, you make basically kind of lunch money or maybe if it's a really good one, you'll make rent money, but not pay the mortgage off money. And we're talking and somebody's like, yeah, we would do that. And I'm the foremost expert in Webpack right now. And we can make that. And it could be an Egghead course. But I really wanna make that West boss money. And I was like, I don't really know exactly what that means, but I know what West does, right? Like I know what goes into building a course and maintaining a platform and doing all this stuff. And what we did and internally, I was like, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna make West boss as a service. So we have software as a service and we do West boss as a service. And we've worked with Ken C. Dodds, Dan Abramoff and Emma Bostian. And released these different things and kind of released courses for people where it's a true partnership. You know, we do like revenue share and all that. And it works out. Like everybody's happy because they don't have to do all this stuff, right? Like they don't, they have to create the content and they get a chill and create the content and not worry about all of the support and handling requests and delivery and marketing and all that fun stuff. Because it's a lot of work. And it truly is like just a ton of work. And if you're sitting and doing it yourself, you can do that. And we often use this, you know, you can have a whole grape or you can share a grapefruit is the way we kind of phrase it. So, you know, I really think building a course platform can be something that's fundamentally rewarding and interesting if that's what you're interested in. And, you know, if it really is interesting to you, right? Yeah, yeah, that's true. And there's a lot of people that are experts in a specific topic because that's their full-time job. And they don't necessarily want to or have time to build it, market it, design it, you know, all of that stuff that is in addition to actually making the course. What makes me frustrated and something that I try to solve for is those folks that will never, they will probably never even write a blog post, right? Like they are so into what they do and their expertise, but what they do is so interesting. And it's like, how do you get those folks and amplify that expertise and then teach other people how to do those things is something that I really have kind of tried to figure out and it's like a long-term challenge for me, like how do you get this list of developers that will never do this thing to actually do something or at least, you know, be the expert in the production process, like that sort of thing. Beautiful, yeah, I agree. Wes, thank you so much for hanging out with me and chatting today, I really appreciate it. I appreciate what you do. I will continue to be impressed and inspired by your work and just can't thank you enough. Oh, thank you, I appreciate that, that's very kind. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm pretty excited to talk to you today. You are a fan of remote work and I am a long-term fan of remote work and that's your area of expertise. And I'm curious just to kind of kick it off when you sit down to personally learn something new, when you're learning a new topic, what's your approach? Like how do you dig in and get after something new and complex? For me personally, I have to tie it back to something that I'm trying to solve in real life. So it can't just be like, Oh, I'm interested in this topic. I want to dive in. It has to be like, Oh, I'm solving X problem. And what can I learn about why in order to solve it better or have more information going into it? So that's kind of how I approach learning. Do you go after like a book or once you've got your problem space and you kind of understand why you're doing this in the first place, cause it's associated with some sort of real life actual problem and not just for the sake of learning, what do you do at that point? Is it all the five-star books on Amazon or what's your kind of approach? I go everywhere. I love diving fully in. So I'm, you know, I'm going into articles, I'm reading books. I might join a couple of course. I pretty much dive into everything. Are you a fan of online courses in general? Is that something that you make a habit of? And what are you looking for when you're out there seeking a new course for your own personal learning? I'm a huge fan of online courses because I really like learning at my own pace. And that really provides that. So it depends on the topic I'm looking at. I'll take various courses. So I've done cohort based courses that are live. I've done, you know, just standard recorded courses and everything in between. I think it depends on what I'm learning and what my aim is. So with live courses, if I need more accountability or if I'm looking to join a community and have that network, then I'm going to join a live course. If I actually want to learn the topic and really dive in there, then I'm most likely going to do a recorded course, just because that's how I learn best is in my own time with my own resources. You built a framework and I think that's interesting because not everybody sits down and builds frameworks or invents frameworks for how they work. Can you explain the work forward approach and what you did with this framework and why it exists? Yeah. So I founded a fractional head of remote company in 2018 called Remote Work Prep. And I would frequently go into companies and talk about asynchronous work. And there was this instant reaction negatively towards asynchronous work. They thought it might be slow. They thought it might be difficult. They just instantly had that reaction and that made it really hard to help them learn how to work effectively asynchronously because you're working against these preconceived notions. So instead I created a framework called the work forward approach that basically has eight principles that help people work asynchronously without having the asynchronous name attached to it. So I'm kind of jumping forward from those preconceived notions and instead diving into things that actually make sense to people and help them work asynchronously. I assume when you're coming up with something, because to me that reminds it like a framework is and developing a framework is probably related to instructional design and you've brought that forward and you're teaching a course now and I assume that has some sort of relation when you're thinking about that, when you're starting to kind of build the material to present as a framework, what's your research process like when you're doing that? Because that's different than finding a course to learn something new. Now you are an actual expert and you are teaching people your expertise. So what does that research process look like for you? It starts way before I even think about building a course. So I'm a big fan of starting from a service based approach if you're starting a business because you're in like the root of the issue, you're talking directly with customers, you're getting all these questions and you're seeing the pain points. And then over time, if you see pain points that are like repeated or questions that keep coming up or resources that you just can't find to give to people and you're solving it yourself, then you kind of have this thought like, hey, maybe a course would be best for this problem area. So that's kind of how I approach is that I first start by digging into what they're dealing with. And then comes the idea of the course rather than just I'm going to start a course based off this topic just because that's what I want to talk about. And then the next thing I typically do is I define the starting state of what my ideal student would be coming from. And then I define the ending state of what I'm hoping to get them to. And then I define how do I get them to slowly turn and make that state change from beginning to end point. So my courses typically look like a pyramid where I'm building a foundation and slowly guiding them to the top rather than, you know, throwing lessons at them just because that's what you're supposed to learn in that sequence. It's more guided and more intentional than that. I think it's interesting also that you are referring back to the starting places, defining a real life problem. So regardless of whether you are learning something yourself or teaching it to others, the real life problem is an important aspect of teaching and learning the kind of takeaway for me there. So I want to go back and talk about cohort based courses versus self-paced courses and how do you choose between which one as a teacher to bring to the table and when is one more appropriate than the other? I took an experimental approach. So I kind of dove in with both of them just to see what I learned as a teacher. And I've also done it from a student approach and then building on that knowledge. So when it comes to being a student, like I said, like it depends on what you're targeting. For me, if I'm looking for that network, I'm going to go the CBC route. And then if I'm looking for like actually learning the material, I'm more likely to go the recorded route. In the same way with like teaching, I kind of think about that. Like, where are my students coming from? Do they need a network or do they need the information? What do they need more? And then the final thing that I really think about is that I am a huge introvert and it takes a ton of energy for me to do a live course. So I'm very partial to doing more recorded or something like where the content is recorded, but then you have things like office hour calls and like guest speakers and just like monthly events where it enhances the content through creating a community and live events, but everything isn't live. So it's not as hard on me as an introvert. Yeah. It's not a constant scheduled process, but it gives you a way to, to also have the benefits, almost like a hybrid approach at that point. I've heard it, I've heard it called maybe the flip classroom is something that I've heard about where you, where people will watch the lesson and watch the lecture beforehand and then show up live and discuss it and have that sort of thing so you're not having to be on a podium, you were just having a nice discussion with people, which to me is sometimes easier than in your process. And I know you started when you're teaching people about remote work. It started at the remote work prep starts as a cohort based course and the first kind of iterations that I saw you creating and now it's moving more towards the async. And I'm wondering like, is the, you know, when you're doing that live, is that also part of the research process in terms of defining it and working with students and how does that work for you in terms of developing the course further? So I don't even start with the CBC. So I start one-on-one when I'm consulting with a company and I'm working with people one-on-one and, you know, companies and diving into their level. And it's not until I get that, where I feel like it's at a good level that I even start building a course. So with mastering remote leadership, which is for managers or team leads that have to lead teams remotely. I started that, like I said, one-on-one. Then I built a CBC around it. And now I'm converting that course based on feedback and based on what worked and what didn't into this hybrid model that I'm talking about. So it's kind of like an evolutionary process and I take a kind of experimental approach to everything that I go into. Like, I'm not expecting everything to work perfectly. I'm expecting to learn from this and to get better in the next iteration of it. So every time you perform this and whether it's one-on-one or a cohort-based course or the self-paced version, it's always a constant return and reevaluate and present a process to people where they have a starting state and an ending state and you're designing something. And I assume a big part of this is designing a process that actually works is an important caveat there. I think, I honestly, I think there's a lot of people out there designing, and I use the air quotes there in a way that is more like, this is how the process could be, or how I think about it in my head versus like what you were talking about where you were actually working with individuals and then groups, small groups, and then saying, Hey, this actually works so you can do it on your own, but not until you've got to the point where you feel comfortable as a, an instructor and purveyor of courses to sell it to them as such, is that, that's exactly it. Yeah. I love that. Like I'm a big, huge fan of that entire way of thinking about process in general versus a process that's a lie. And maybe that's a little harsh on people, but like a process that's a lie versus the process that actually works and is repeatable is a big difference. And I think there's a lot of, a lot of room we can move towards thinking about processes in real life. The thing I like to think about is that my number one goal is to help that evolution. So like everything else is a side thing to that. So I want something that's proven. I want something that's actionable. I want something that can work for multiple people. So like people have different learning styles and they come on with different environments and experiences, and I still want them to get just as much as this other person who has a totally different experience. That's my goal is to make it actionable and to make sure that it's something that follows them outside of the course. So even when you're in the course and you're fully, deeply ingrained in the topic, I don't want it to be like memorization where you just know what I told you. I want you to know how to think about things outside of the course once you leave it so that you can make just as good decisions then. Like helping people build their own system, basically, and transfer it to whatever their context is, because it's really difficult to define that for everybody. But how do you do that? How do you define who your course is for in the first place so that you'll know that the people coming into it are going to be successful? That goes back to what I'm doing, like working one-on-one with people. And I'm seeing like, who is this really speaking to? Who really needs this issue solved? And then I'll solve it for them specifically before I branch out to other people. How do you know for sure when somebody has been successful with a course? Oh, there's a lot of different things. So like there's metrics. So if we look at their calendar, it typically starts with like 80% meetings. And then all of a sudden, it's down to like 20% meetings per week and like that evolutionary growth there. Then it's like things like their, so for my Mastering Remote Leadership course, that would be things like their team members saying, hey, I know what I have to do. I can do it in a healthy way. I'm not having unrealistic expectations put on me anymore. Or like for my Avoiding Burnout from Remote Work course, it's more about, hey, I have a healthier approach to remote work. I'm not instantly replying to messages. I'm not, you know, feeling burnt out and constantly on that cycle all the time. And I get those comments. So I know I'm doing something right. And that's kind of how I go about it. Yeah. I wanted to ask if learner feedback affects your courses. And to me, I think the answer is probably an obvious yes, because that, and as far as I can tell, measuring that success and understanding and following up with them sounds like it's also an important part, like giving them feedback and how do you manage that long-term? How do you manage the need to like provide feedback to people, especially as you move more towards, you know, kind of the self-based paced version. And, you know, the feedback cycle is a little slower, I think, in those than in the cohort based, but how do you manage that? It's a million percent important to me. Yeah. Yeah. So I, I definitely want to know what's working and what doesn't. I definitely want to know like what can be improved, what they thought was missing, all of that. And I think the start of that is just creating an environment where people can feel like they can ask questions and they feel like they can give feedback without hurting your feelings or without, you know, coming across as rude or, you know, like I make that environment extremely open. I'm constantly asking for that. Another thing that we do is that there's a survey at the beginning of the, the course asking for where they're currently at and asking all these questions related to that. And then a survey at the end of the course, which has very similar questions to see where they're at to see like what kind of transformation was made there. So I do things like that as well. Are you at this point doing this all by yourself or have you gotten to the point where you started to bring help in? I am a solopreneur. So it's just me right now. I do use contractors for some things, sometimes for remote work prep, but not yet for my courses. Is that something that you would stick to? Cause I know it totally changes the dynamic of the work when you start having to manage or collaborate, whether you're managing or not, is that something you plan on in the future or do you prefer the kind of solo approach to this sort of stuff? It depends on the day. I feel that I like, I feel that for sure. Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, I'm going to be a solopreneur forever. This is great. And then other days I'm like, I need help. This is crazy. How am I doing everything? No, but so my background is in software engineering and product management. And while I started my company in 2018, it was just supposed to be a side project. It's something I did for fun because I was passionate about remote work and I wanted to help other people have positive remote work experiences. 2020 happened, things exploded. I still had my head of product job at a software company until summer 2021. And that's when I went full-time with remote work prep. So it's been about six to eight months-ish at this point. And after leading teams for so long, it is kind of nice to have that kind of breadth of this is about what I want to do and where I want to go and how I want to run this business. I really enjoy leading people and I really enjoy leading teams. So I doubt I'll stay away from it forever, but I first want to get my footing and make sure that the company is going in the direction that I want it to go before building it. Do you think in a way, the, as an instructor and educator, you're, you are leading and is that like your previous role as a head of product in your current role as, you know, the instructor for this course, is there overlap between those two? I think so. I think so because to me, I, so growing up, I had always thought when I'm a manager, I'm going to be in charge and this is going to be great. And then I become a manager and I'm like, whoa, it's not about being in charge. It's about being in service and service. Exactly. So you're in service to the people that you're leading, you're helping them have the environment they need to succeed. And that's the exact same thing I'm doing as an educator. I'm making sure that my students have the environment, the information, the resources, everything they need to succeed. I mean, even down to like the safe place to, for feedback and asking and like constantly, I think there's a, an incredible overlap between product development, product management and instructional design that's often overlooked because I feel like as leaders, that's really what you have to do is bring in information, do the research, share it with your team so they can reach those goals to start. They're here, they need to be there. And how do we get them there? And so in my head, there's a lot of overlap just in terms of philosophy and kind of some of the ethics of the process. I think there's also overlap in the frustration that happens when you become a manager or become an instructor. So typically like people have reached a certain point in their career as an IC, and then they just get promoted to management without any training on how to be an effective manager. And same thing for lead or for teaching people, like you reach a certain seniority and you're just expected to teach people these different things without any training on actually how to teach. So they both go through that same process of being pushed into this role without proper training on how to actually go about it effectively. Do you have a background in instructional design? Did that ever come up for you? Or is that something that you've had to research on your own? So my background is interesting. I was homeschooled starting in fifth grade and then I skipped a grade and I started taking college courses when I was 15. I ended up dropping out of college to join a startup and then was in the tech space for a while, so no formal instructional design, but I did have to learn how to teach myself and I think that influences everything I do because of that knowledge is in that I'm not just reading something and saying, okay, I'm memorizing this. I want to deeply ingrain this. I want to learn how to live by this. I want to learn how to create processes and approaches and things that work outside of when I'm specifically learning about this topic. So I think that all goes into it. Do you have any favorite frameworks or resources that you've used that along the way, just pretty much strictly in terms of instructional design, but otherwise that have kind of informed how you approach that design process? I really like starting from a question-based approach. So starting from a place of getting people to think about things on their own before you even supply them with ideas or, you know, answers just to see what do they come up with, how does this expand their mind, what do they go looking for once they have these questions that can be really good on like the student side, because it's opening their mind, it's less boring, they're interacting. And then on the teaching side, you learn so much from where they go with their answers. And one of my favorite personal frameworks, it's called understanding by design. And it was my kind of introduction into the foray of instructional design. They take that and they call them essential questions where we want to ask people questions that, that don't really have an answer. Like there's no definite, it's not a yes or no. It's something that we're going to contemplate and sparks discussion. And you really have to think deep in terms of this and then breaking those questions down into like the sub questions that you, now we need to understand that until eventually you might get down to statements, but you know, like the, that's not what's interesting. The answers and solutions, it's the discussion, right? Like the spark in them. So you have a software development background, but you have not leveraged that to build a bespoke custom course platform for yourself. Instead, you've gone with something off the shelf and I'm wondering what the trade-offs are there and where, what kind of prompted that decision? And basically if you have any tips on self-restraint, so those of us that feel like we have to build from scratch could learn from you.  Yeah. So, like I said, I am a solopreneur. I have, you know, limited time. I am running a company based off the lifestyle I want. And my lifestyle is not hustle culture. My lifestyle is not working 60 plus hours a week. It's instead making my work revolve around my life. And sometimes that means making decisions like that, where I'm not building something, even though I think it would be cool and fun and, you know, exciting. But instead I'm saying no to that and I'm taking the easy route so that I can accomplish what I actually set out to do. And what I actually set out to do is making sure that students can learn from this course. And I can't have them learn from the course if I'm spending months building out a platform. So. And you're maintaining it at that point too. So you not only build it, but now you've created a maintenance burden for yourself long-term. And the other thing is courses aren't my only thing. So like I have the fractional head of remote services. I have my content. So I have like a newsletter and then I also have courses on top of that and everything else on the side. So it's not the only thing. So it can't be me building everything from scratch. I was going to ask how you, cause you don't, you said you don't really dig into hustle culture and I appreciate that. And I'm wondering just based on my observation, I wouldn't say you do what would traditionally be in the field of marketing, but how do people find you? And what is your approach to marketing your courses and services? Yeah. I still have this reaction when I hear the word marketing. I know. That's what it's like. You don't want to say it out loud and it carries such heavy weight, but at the end of the day, we have to do it. And I think there's probably some balance of marketing that isn't the kind of a salesy kind of. Yeah. Yeah. So it's funny because I am a huge introvert and I was not very online. Before 2020 and then 2020 hit. And my, like I said, my business was there since 2018 and exploded overnight and all of a sudden I had all these incoming requests, but they required one-on-one support. And I only have so much time in the day. I couldn't keep up with them. So I started sharing online. I started sharing on Twitter because I knew no one on the platform. And so if I thought if I fail miserably, no one will know it'll be great. Of course that didn't end up happening. That's why I started there. And I started just by answering people's questions. So I would see people making statements about remote work that I felt weren't fully accurate or having questions or struggles, and I would just start chiming into the conversation. So it was literally just commenting on other people's posts. And then I hit like 1000 followers and then I started posting on my own. And now it's been like a year and a half and I'm at like 8,000 followers, which is crazy to me. I still look at the number. I'm like, that's not real. So a lot of people find me through Twitter. I'm also, I also have my own blog and my newsletter, Remotely Interesting, which has a thousand plus subscribers. I don't remember how many. I'm also part of many groups and I really take, so, so the reason why I got into this and how I was able to ease myself into it was by taking that 30 by 500 course that gave me a, yeah, exactly. That gave me a different perspective to marketing. So it wasn't about selling things to people. It was about helping people and I can get fully on board with helping people. I will help people all day. So that's kind of the approach I take to marketing. I mean, you're in good company with 30 by 500 and Amy and Alex. And when I think about marketing, my personal philosophy is very informed by what I've learned from them and their kind of mentorship over, we're almost 15 years into like me participating in what they are putting out there and it is really fantastic and kind of just a life changing way to make that word not so, because it isn't like, and that all makes sense to me because you know, when you talk about looking for pain and solving pain and helping people and this idea of service and that sort of thing, I think that's such a healthy way to approach this and I've seen it and I've seen you in action on Twitter and that's, you know, like that's where we met. And really it shines at the end of the day. I can, can see that you're putting 30 by 500 into practice. Definitely. And it's the only way that's been sustainable for me. So if I had tried to like push back on, I'm not an introvert. I'm going to go, you know, full out and just start selling people and try to do it in the car salesman kind of way, I would have lasted like a month, maybe. But now I've been in it for a couple of years online now, and I like it. I actually like going online. I like helping people, even though I'm in the public eye more, and that's less, that's outside of my comfort zone. It's still a sustainable approach that I can absolutely get on board with. Yeah. And I, I feel that, and I kind of push myself, you know, my natural inclination is to kind of be a cave dwelling nerd type and just do my thing and do work and help people when they've asked and do that sort of thing. But, you know, like being out there and doing this thing and talking to people is also very rewarding too. So it's been a nice transition. What's your long-term goal in terms of, product empire really isn't the right word, but what's your long-term goal in terms of building and sustaining your business that you've started? My business has been sustainable from day one. We've always been profitable. That's just been incredibly important to me. I'm also bootstrapped and I plan on staying that way, at least for now. I took a very, very long approach to switching over to my company full time because I wanted that financial freedom. So I had, you know, this tech exec job, very comfortable. It was very rewarding as well. Like I liked my team members and all of that. So it felt like a difficult decision to give that up because honestly, I go, I grew up in a very poor background. That job that I had was like my dream life. And to say no to that for something that I was building, that wasn't a for sure thing, seemed like the craziest thing in the entire world. So it took me a long time. So first I started with like a four day work week at my job so that I would have extra time for my side company. Then over the summer when I had to teach the CBC, I did a two month entrepreneurial leave from my full-time job. And then when I was supposed to come back, that's when I officially quit and I converted my employer to be a client. So I didn't do the approach that a lot of people do where they just quit and they just have faith, like I'll figure it out. I was definitely like, I am very risk averse. How do I go about this in a way that creates kind of psychological safety and healthiness around what I'm doing? And my income from my company exceeded what I was making in the tech exec job by the time I quit. So it was more than healthy. I plan on, my goal this year is to switch. So last year, 80% of my revenue came from services and 20% from products. I want to flip those percentages this year. So I'd love it to be 80% products and 20% services. That's hard because I do a lot of services. But I do have six product launches planned for this year, including the one I just released on the avoiding burnout from remote work mini course. So yeah, I'm working hard at it. So this, I'm just curious if you, the 30 by 500 process. And when you took that course, which is one of my favorites online. Was that before you quit? Did you take that before? Oh yes, I took that in February, 2020. So right before my business went insane. Wow. That, that is really fantastic. And I'd love to meet another kind of, kind of nerd of a feather, maybe. Just somebody that's doing this and doing it in a way that I really love to see. Marissa, thank you so much for taking time out of your day and chatting with me. I really appreciate it. Of course. Yes. Thank you so much for having me. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm really stoked to talk to you because we've worked together for a while now and we've had similar interests and we both like making courses and teaching people and helping people grow as software developers. So there's a ton of stuff to talk about. I'm really curious about Rust and your experience building a course platform and creating a course in that space. I wanted to ask before we dig into that though, like when you were sitting down to learn something new, something complex, whether it's technical or otherwise, what's your approach to learning a complex subject? I will say that I started my career with the ActionScript 3 like bible book, which if you've never seen it before is like this giant thick like meaty flash book, right? And I just sat down and I banged my head against it and sat in a computer lab that I had access to with the Adobe software that I had access to and I just effectively banged my head against the book until it works. That was the book I learned how to code off of, that's what's funny to me because that's literally like how I learned how to program was with that with Essential ActionScript 3 by Colin Mook was my introduction and just like shouldered into it until like it finally clicked like, oh this is what a class is. It took me so long, I didn't get it. For so long I think, especially around that time when I was, I had no idea what programming really was. I was like, why are these symbols like that? Are they important like that? Or do I, does it need to be like that? Like does the, what is that? Just stumbling along and like, that's the really, that's the way that I then learned too. So like at one point I was doing Haskell professionally and getting paid for contracting doing that. And the way I learned that is banging my head against it for years and it's the same thing with anything else. So now when I run up against like a library that is underdocumented or something like that, I'm just like fall back on the old process, just bang my head against it until it hurts quite a bit. And then for some reason I'm a person that keeps doing that. So I don't really have a, yeah, nobody's going to like that answer because that's a really painful answer. Just shouldering in and suffering until you have learned it enough to use it is kind of like how I might describe that. Yeah. What keeps you going? Like what keeps you motivated when you're in that process though? Because it's very frustrating. I like personally, like when I learned how to code, it was pre-internet. And I remember like I called it the chapter four problem because I would get there and it would just be like, I don't understand. This isn't for me. I give up now. But what keeps you going when you, you're like, how do you know it's worth it? How do you know it's worth it is a very different question than how do you keep going? Maybe that's true. So like when I learned how to program, I didn't know what programmers got. I charged. So I started my career freelancing and I was charging like $15 an hour or whatever. Right. Like, like basically what people always are like, yeah, this should be the minimum wage. Yeah. And I was like, I don't know, it's better than working at McDonald's. So I guess I'll keep doing this. It's true though, too. And it makes it easier to get gigs at that point too. And I'd like just charging a really low rate. So people will say yes. And actually give me the chance to try. There is something to be said for like, when you don't have the skills and the expertise and the negotiation ability and the network and the audience and all of these other things, right. It's just getting something. But also later on, you learn that software engineers don't make $15 an hour, but like, I didn't know any of that. So like the motivation for me is intrinsic, like it's internal. It's the only way that I do things is if I want to do things. Yeah. I got recently diagnosed with ADHD and stuff like that. So like, it makes a little bit more sense to me these days, but like, I don't do well with authority and external deadlines and people telling me what to do and all of that kind of shit. Imagine that. So I don't, if it's not internal motivation, if it's not something I want to be doing, if I don't have like my reason for doing it, whatever that is, whether it's, I like, even to the extent of like, I need to pay rent almost isn't good enough for me to keep my, that's just somebody else telling you what to do. And like, I don't have people depending on me either. So if you have a brood, right? Like if you have people that are relying on you to pay their rent, that changes the whole perspective. Cause I'm, I'm such the same way. If you tell me what to do, like my first instinct is like, no, just flat. I didn't even, it's totally reasonable request. Just like, no, I'm not going to do that. But no, I think that actually makes my next question more interesting because you're focusing on rust and you've chosen an area to, to teach and educate in. And to me, based on what you just said, that means that, you know, like this is something that you want to do that you really like, that you think is a good idea. And, and what, what drew you into the programming language rust? And why did you choose that as a focus in terms of your own expertise development and then as something to teach to others? I feel like on some level, I've always had a fairly good, like ability to pick the next technology I need to be working with. Like I picked react in like 2013, 2014, and that's been going for almost 10 years now, which is pretty nice. And like, obviously I don't pick everything correctly, but like rust to me seemed like a thing that all of the smart people that I knew were talking about again. And I went to use the language and probably due to my personal contextual history with other languages and having worked across a number of them at this point, I saw rust and I was like, well, it has all the things I like about like the JavaScript ecosystem, right? Like NPM for all of its works. And like the package management works of JavaScript is really nice. Like, I don't want to go back to a land where like, like go before modules or like C plus or something like that. Right? Like, I don't want, I mean, like at least Maven has some like dependency management kind of stuff, right? Like I don't want to go back into a world where it's like, we expect you to have all of the source that you're ever going to compile in this repo. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with that. So like NPM and then NPM scripts and all of like the higher level tools on top of that were like things that I really like about the tooling that I'm working with and rust has that. And it has that I think done at a better level, right? Like. It's an iteration on that concept too, right? Like, so they're iterating on NPM, which is iterating on, you know, Ruby gems, which is iterating on, you know, like the stuff that proceeded before that too, I think. Yeah. I mean, there's something to be said for the fact that like rust came after all of these other things, right. Which means they got to learn from all of them. And like, that doesn't always happen. Sometimes people are just like, Oh, I want C, but like, whatever, some minor change. And it's like, then it's just C without the ecosystem. Yeah. But yeah, so I saw that. And then I started using rust and I really liked it as a language in addition to all the tooling and stuff. And I saw the capacity for it to be like embedded in other languages like JavaScript. So this was like, I don't know, three years ago or something. I was making the decision to like get into rust and whatnot. So that kind of goes back. And I'd assume over time, like when you first learned how to program and you sat down with the action script three book to like shoulder in, that's a totally different experience than when you sat down to like learn and research rust. So what was that approach? Like, like, how do you approach that? I'm sure it's similar, like you're still shouldering in, but you have a higher resolution insight into it also. So what was your research process when you, you know, decided to teach rust? When I decided to teach rust, my iterations looked a lot different, right? When I decided to learn rust, it was somewhat similar, but like, I've been through, I don't know, almost double digits in languages these days. Like, so like, seeing new syntax to me isn't scary. Yeah, you don't have to learn what an array is. And it's not a concept that you have to even think of as a, as an example. Like, yeah, I can talk about things and make them sound scary, just like anybody else, right? As a teacher, I try not to do that. But yeah, when I go to learn something for like the perspective of teaching it, you have to learn it on a much deeper level, right? You have to learn it because people are going to ask you really random questions about things that you never thought about. So like researching to teach is researching to figure out what everybody else's problems are. Whereas researching to learn is like researching to get past your own roadblocks, which you can often skip without even like really addressing, right? But if you're researching to teach, you have to go and you have to find the things that everybody else is running into. You have to aggregate those into, okay, most people will hit this, a bunch of people will hit that. And then like, these are the things I need to explain to like, get everybody to the next step without, without doing the thing of like, I'm going to dive into three concepts you don't know, because I'm smart, right? Kind of showing off your knowledge versus helping them solve their problems, I guess would be. Yeah, I feel like that's a problem. A lot of people fall into where it's like, I'm going to show off that I know this. When often teaching to people who don't know what you know, you will look like you don't know what you're talking about to people who want to be aggressive, right? Or whatever. And you look at them and you're just like, yeah, but I'm talking to somebody who doesn't know what any of that is, right? Like, I can't use these words. I can't use the word idempotent. If you don't already know what that is, because that's just layering like another big technical word on top of whatever I'm trying to teach you. I'm going to say it does the same thing every time you call it, right? Like there, there are different ways of talking about things that you need to definitely jargon has its place. And it's like, but it's, it's like a lossy format, right? Like it's compression of, of concepts and do something you can speak tersely. And then it can be thrown around and uncomfortable ways, maybe, or just the context where it isn't, it isn't appropriate, right? Like in some contexts, it's the higher level, like the next steps to like what we've talked about in the past and what we've been talking about for years at this point in the instructional design arena, where what you're doing was building basically higher level heuristics and abstractions and procedures and like building on top of at some point, talking about things being commutative or idempotent or whatever big word you want to use, like means something to the other set of people who are also speaking at a certain level about a certain thing in a certain way. That very often is not what you do when you're teaching somebody something, but it is something that two people on the same sort of wavelength can say and communicate ideas faster. Right. It's like, not everybody needs to get to that point, but like, it's just another aspect of that. Yeah. It's like impression. Optimization at the end of the day is how I kind of look at it. Cause you know, like I find it's in, you get down into like initialisms and whatnot, where we're reducing things into just purely their initials. When we're having a conversation, it's like, hold up. I have no idea what, what that even means. And I've been doing this for a long time. And you know, it's like, you have to be aware of that, especially when you're teaching people and introducing new words and not supporting that. It's huge with rust and you're designing it and you've decided to teach it and you have a course. What, what are people looking for? Like, what is bringing people to rust the language in terms of their problems or the difference that they're trying to achieve with a new programming language? I think I see really like two big groups. I see the people who are either all, we're already working somewhere or had just got a new job and now they have to deal with rust on some level. Right. So they have to figure it out and they have to be productive at it because now for some reason it's their job to deal with it. And then there's the other group of people who are like, and I focus on more dynamic language people like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, I don't really teach for C developers. That's not to say the content doesn't work for C developers. It's just that like, I'm going to talk a lot less about memory and registers and what, what have you. And I'm going to talk a lot more about like things that JavaScript people care about. Yeah. Kind of to switch gears and maybe talk a little bit about instructional design philosophy. What makes a good course in your opinion? I think that the higher order bit for me is that transfer, right? Like if you do a course and the person ends your course and they're like, went through a course, but like, I don't really know what to do with any of this. That's a, that's not a good course, right? Like you failed something for somebody in this case, it's somebody specific, but like transfer being like knowledge transfer, where they're taking what they have learned in your course and then applying it to whatever is going on in their life. Right. If they can't use what you taught them to do what they want to do, then they are no better off than where they were when they started. Right. If you're at the same place, when you start the course and when you end the course, like the course, isn't a good course, right? Like the person hasn't learned anything. Well, it has to make a difference, right? Like, so if there is no difference then. Yeah. So like they have to be able to do something that they weren't able to do before. And that's what I, that's what kind of what I mean when I say transfer. How do you know when, you know, like when you're watching people or talking to people that are actually involved in your course right now, like how do you know that they are meeting their goals when they're going through the process? So we have a discord for the rest of venture stuff and the people in the discord are doing various things like for realistically, sometimes I won't know. Yeah. Right. Some people go through, go through the workshops, do all the work, get all the stuff done. And then they walk off to their job and they start doing it at their job. And they really just like, they're done. They never come back or like they learned the thing they needed to learn. And now they are using it, which is great, but like not something that you can necessarily guarantee that they come back and tell you, but there are people that come back and go, Oh, I did like the 2048 course or whatever. And I made this game and now I'm going to make a clone of wordle on my own. Right. So like when you see people starting to do that, I think that's when you have a thing that is capturing that goal of like the transfer, right? If the people are able to take the course and then feel like they can go do their own thing, even if they like hit a bunch of roadblocks, when they go to do it, if they feel like they can do their own thing after they do the course, there's something good about that. Right. And you can follow that. And then when they try to go do their own thing and they start running into roadblocks, you get that feedback because they're in the discord or whatever. And they're like, Oh, I'm trying to do this thing. We didn't really cover this in the course or whatever. Have you had any success stories since you started teaching that were like, just made it just feel like this is totally worth it. I think anytime anybody ever does one of my things and is like, yeah, I accomplished it. I did what I set out to do before I used your thing is like just such a bright star moment, right? Whether that's like, Oh, I eventually got a promotion from going through all of your stuff. Or like, I learned this thing and now I feel more confident or just I did like I have that open graph images course, right on again, I love that bunch of people go through that. It's kind of hilarious, because a lot of people like go try to do simpler versions of it, that eventually realized they actually need the thing the course does. And they end up like they've known about the course the whole time. And then they eventually hit a point where they're like, Oh, that's why this exists. Okay. And then they go through it. And then they have their open graph images being generated in a serverless function cached on cloudinary, whatever. And they're just they're like, they have they have the thing that they wanted in the first place. And that's a success, right? Like, when I think about like the rest of venture stuff, I'm thinking about transfer skills. But even on the level of like, this project is a useful project. It teaches you a number of skills like serverless functions, puppeteer, playwright, whatever cloudinary, but the result of that course is really like, you have the thing that you wanted, when you came to it, right? It's a kind of a direct action course, as opposed to a curriculum course. I think that's really interesting in on a couple of levels. And one of them is, how do you decide what to build for an example, either through a course, or, you know, whether you're writing or how do you decide what the example is going to be? I think people struggle with that a lot. That's definitely research, right? Like there's either, there can be problems that I have, right? In which case, it's like, it's like, it's a problem that I have, like the open graph image thing, where then like, that's the thing that other people also ran into, or it's research, and I'm researching like, what problems other people are having, and what they're having trouble with. And then you build a example, basically based off of that, right? Like, what example can I build that addresses the problem these people are having, in a way that lets me explain and build up to it, so that when they end it, they can go off and do whatever they want, whenever they want. When you're in the design process, do you get any feedback from people? Do you have a way of sharing that or, you know, beta testing, for lack of a better term, the content from, you know, like during the workshops, or how do you approach this testing cycle and getting feedback from? Yeah, it's a very large spread, actually, from writing blog posts, and seeing how people react to it, to doing YouTube videos, and seeing how people react to it, and live streaming, and seeing what people, what questions people have when they come into the chat, all the way through to like, I've now gone through a bunch of the problematic stuff. I've designed a curriculum or a set of lessons or whatnot. And there's a set of videos now, that are in like their raw cut format, like a rough edit. And I'll give the rough edit to somebody and be like, this, like, do you want to go through this, like actually do it. And finding the people who will actually like, full on beta test something for you, and actually do it, and then actually provide feedback, is a very hard thing to do on its own. But if you can find that group of people, you're pretty good, right? What is the live streaming? How has that influenced your kind of process and design in terms of developing a course? I think that's really interesting. It's something you've been practicing for quite some time. The live streaming is really interesting, because it's like an early testing ground, right? It is a, I can do very early, like I have a inkling of an idea about something, right? Or I have a just a thing I want to accomplish or something like that. And I can take that to a live stream. And nobody really expects polished content on a live stream, they expect like to be able to hang out and talk to you. And it's a, I bet some point, I imagine we'll talk about marketing, but like a deepening of a trust relationship with the people that I interact with on a regular basis, around all of the the rest courses and material and stuff like that. Live streams are really good for like, being I'm a person and you're a person and we're talking. And like, you can ask questions as I'm going through this, if you don't, like recognize something. And like, I can answer your questions. But also every question somebody asks, is like a marker, a note, a point that I go back to, right? So that's what that is. I haven't done a lot of I haven't done a lot of live streaming, but I've done in-person workshops, which in a way is a live streaming and meet space, I guess. And it's the same thing, right? Like if you do this and you're either running through your examples, but the times when people actually ask questions, and if you do these things more than once, you'll notice there's these natural places where people ask questions or you can, you know, you'll see the looks on their faces or the questions come up in chat. And I think that's like that experience is pretty fantastic in terms of design, because you don't have to have, it's not as polished and permanent, I guess. I think that the people always feel like they're bothering other people, right? Like they always feel like, oh, I shouldn't ask this. I'm bothering them. Oh, this feels like a silly question. Like I shouldn't have to ask this. I should just go figure it out on my own. But the key insight there is that what they don't understand is that every time somebody asks me a question anywhere on the internet, in my life, whatever, that is a thing that I know that somebody had to ask. And that feedback is really invaluable when it comes down to actually building courses and curriculum and doing the actual work of developing something that addresses the problems that people actually run into, right? So like, I'm always happy to like get questions. And like, sometimes, maybe I don't know, sometimes maybe I don't have the time, sometimes whatever. But I'm always happy to like, get a question. And then I can at least be like, oh, that direction. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a common problem, just in people want to like, either figure it out or don't want to pester us. And us being the anybody, they don't want to pester anybody about whatever, you know, they think their questions bad and won't ask it. And it's really true that the phrase, there's no bad questions, I think really kind of holds up. Yeah, I have, I have feelings about that phrase, because like, there are no bad questions, if you're doing it while you're learning while whatever, but there are bad faith questions. Yeah, I think that there's definitely an asterisk. No, no bad questions asterisk asked in good faith. Because you can definitely I mean, the internet's full of trolls. So it's a wonderful and horrible place. You've been running your course for a while now. And it hasn't, you know, it's I think you were about six months in and I don't know if this has been a concern yet. But maintenance of video courses, in particular maintenance of courses in general, I think is can be difficult. And I was wondering, you know, how much time are you finding yourself having to maintain versus working on new stuff on the horizon? Course maintenance for me is tied to version bumps in the like, libraries and stuff, right? I find that to be a very useful, like, point at which to revisit the content. Because there's a natural change, right? So for example, Bevy came out with like 0.6. And the workshop that I initially did is 0.5. So there are, I don't want to call them substantial changes to the workshop, but there are opportunities to remove some of the accidental complexity of the workshop. So it's a good opportunity for me to dig in and be like, Okay, should I redo these videos or not? And I think those are ones that I'm redoing. But the say, digital garden CLI course, or like another CLI course or something like that might just need a note, right? It might just need like a Hey, you know, you're going through this video. And while you're going through this video, you're going to end up with, like this one thing that you need to type in addition, right? So like, it's definitely like when the software version comes out, that's when I deal with do I redo the thing or not? That's when I revisit is the instruction here actually achieving its purpose, right? Because at that point, I will have like a bunch of feedback from people who have gone through the courses and whatnot. And I take that into consideration as well. When you're thinking about your courses, and it's multi modules, and you have existing modules, and there can be improvement there and refinement versus creating additional courses that cover more ground. How do you balance and like, maybe what's the trade offs between working on new content and refining what exists already? Oh, like I said, like the refining, the old stuff happens at particular times, right? There is part of the reason I have a trigger for that, right? Because I could do whatever I want to do at any given time. But software bumps and that there are enough version bumps of libraries or crates or whatever that are used in the workshops, that that makes a natural point at which to revisit. So like, for Rust Adventure, it's a series of workshops, right? Like, a lot of people call it a course or whatever and total. And that I think is a, it's a marketing thing that I probably have to lean in more than lean away from, like, everybody is going to call it a course or whatever, right? Like, like, yeah, meet people where they are, basically, right? Like, I don't need, I don't need people to call it workshops. I don't need people to whatever, but it is a whole set of things, right? So having a corpus of content that is in a couple different streams is where my head is at for that. And that needs more new stuff, right? So I can tell you there's a couple of streams on Rust Adventure right now. One of them is like a CLI stream. And one is like a games stream. And one is like a serverless stream. And then there's a language stream, right? Like, so the first phase of Rust Adventure was basically answering the question, what can you do with Rust? Because that was the most common question I was seeing from people. It was like, I like, what can you even do with this? And like having a bunch of workshops that address that question, like, you can do serverless functions, and you can use CLI tools, and you can build games, and you can whatever made a lot of sense. So there now needs to be like additional, from beginner to advanced in each of those streams, and also a from absolute beginner to being able to take the workshops stream itself. So like the new content is really important in the sense of Rust Adventure. I don't know that's true everywhere, because I feel like a lot of other places do very different kinds of workshops. They'll do one on this framework and one on that framework, and they don't really connect. But I'm trying to build more of a larger curriculum with Rust Adventure. So do you have an idea of what finished looks like in terms of the broad curriculum? It's a really good question there. I have the idea that I have in my head right now, right? And that will not be the finish line, I don't think. But there\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"is the like language learning stream, like the, the intro to Rust, like why would I use it, who cares, some syntax, some like, here's your first program kind of stuff, right. And then there's the use cases streams. And then at some point there is the, I don't need another CLI project. How do I build really good CLIs? And that's like the cap capstone on the end of like the CLI stream set of workshops. Right. It's like the, like, do I include flags to output as JSON or human readable or whatever? Right. The like higher level questions that you can now consider now that you have the underlying like factual skill of this is the crate I'll use. These are the libraries I'll use. This is how I write like a thing that accepts arguments or whatever. So that's what I'm thinking about in terms of like the desired end goal for probably this year is the, there's a bunch of streams that you lead into each other, you can go from language to use cases, and then at the end of the use cases, there is the, this is how you do this on like a, on a metal level. I think what's interesting is because the metal level you describe, you know, like, like what are the considerations that go into really building a great CLI is that expands beyond boundaries of a particular programming language. And that's something that you could probably do in many programming language and might even be useful as a, you know, like as a learner to watch something like that, just so I have a good idea of that. And then, you know, like think about the language level stuff. As a separate concern, even. Yep, for sure. I like, I don't think you need to like sort of take the language workshop before you take the use cases, but it's important to like, just in time, provide that information, right? Like if somebody wants to go through the link, there are people who are like, I need to learn the syntax and I need to learn like the hello world before I can do anything with anything else. And then there are other people who are like, so I'm pretty used to building like hearing SaaS services as my first project, I want to do that. And then they'll go do that. And they'll like, they'll need little tidbits. Like they'll need to reach out. I need you to have those like reach out points available to them. But I don't think that everybody starts in the same spot or ends in the same spot, right? That's interesting. The, the idea that people have their own kind of pet project where they learned every language in the same way. Yeah. Well, one of the things that people try to do a lot with because they grew up in a traditional CS education, like C language environment, is they try to implement linked lists and they're like, this is a simple data structure in my head. This is the basic data structure because they've been told it's the basic data structure or whatever for years and CS degrees and stuff like that. Interviews. Yeah. And like, that's not necessarily true. So there is some aspect of like, if you're writing Java and you want to move to like Haskell, you don't want to write your Haskell as if you were writing Java. Right. You want to learn the new paradigm. So there is something to the effect of like, maybe your pet project isn't applicable to the new situation and maybe you should reconsider, but there is definitely like a whole bunch of approaches that people take and they're not necessarily, which means that like, they may jump from halfway through the 2048 course to like start to do the serverless course because they had something come up at work or whatever. Right. And the way that I think about it is like super Mario 2d world levels. Is the way that I think about rest of venture. So like there's the serverless world and the language world and the whatever, whatever. Right. At some point you unlock the other worlds, but that doesn't mean you like completed every to the extent that it can be completed or whatever. Side quests. Yeah. Many games and that sort of thing. Yeah. I love that. I actually, I think the video game and kind of map analogy works pretty well for a lot of this in terms of learning and how we, we structure it. There's a lot of platforms out there. There's, you know, platforms like Teachable and Podio where you can just go in there and you can throw your videos up there and kind of, kind of run with it. And I'm, I'm wondering why wouldn't you use something like that to just publish your course and cause you've gone through and built a custom course platform. And why not just use something kind of off the rack where you can self-serve and go from there? I saw this question and the questions that you sent to me. And I was like, my, my response is like, convinced me to use one of them. Right. Yeah. There's salespeople might be able to, um, I don't, I, you know, easily my, my, my strongest one would be like, like, it's really easy. You can just put your videos up there, Chris, and push a button. And you're all of a sudden you're selling subscriptions. So it's easy peasy. I mean, that's fine and all, but like a zero control over so many things, right? Like from payment structures to what you can put on the platform to like, whatever. I guess the way I'll phrase it is like, YouTube has a really good UI for setting up a playlist and handing somebody a link and them being able to go through it. With comments and whether people like and dislike and like all of that kind of stuff. If you're not doing a better job than YouTube is, why should I use your thing? Right. Like there is a lot of value in putting up like that YouTube playlist or long video or whatever, because if it's useful, then people will watch it and then you start developing that relationship with them, et cetera, et cetera, like you've been helping people. Right. When I think about like, why did I build my own, you called it a course platform. I don't think anybody's building course platforms really. A platform has a very specific meaning in my head. It means that other people are building businesses on top of your thing. And nobody's really doing that. You're building. Yeah. But it's one business. It's my business, right? Like it's not a platform. It's my product. Yeah. But it's your platform. It's, I mean, it is, it's like your platform. It's literally, you are standing on it and you are the only person standing on it. I'm just going to argue with you for just a second, like semantically speaking, like I agree, like in, in the software world, when we consider a platform would be something where other people are using it, where it's white labeled or something. But I think what you built is, is absolutely a platform and you could take it and other people could use it, whether you chose to do that or not. It's probably, and it's also a different problem space and there's lots of new questions that come up. But I'm going to just say that maybe it's, we don't call it a platform. It's your soapbox, but like it is yours and you are standing on it and you are delivering your courses on it. So for me very much, like I think it is, I think of it as a platform and that's, that's, there's just kind of difference. I do understand where you're coming from. I think soapbox is even worse of a term. Oh, it absolutely is. I'm doing that thing where you offer like a worse alternative and in hopes that you can win your semantic argument. Yeah, for sure. It is a worst time. Yeah. I mean, if, if there's one person on your platform, it's not a platform, right? Like it has to be enabling other people. Like YouTube is a platform because people build businesses on YouTube and have multiple businesses that YouTube is helping drive. You get into this for so long because like your learners are there standing on your platform with you. This really ruins the rest of my questions too, because I have the word course platform over and over again, but so we'll get beyond that. I think we can say, I will accept your platform as I have been for the, the previous, whatever, half hour of this podcast. So, so if you're delivering a course, yeah. What are the essential like software features? Like, what does it, what does a course need to get delivered to the learners that they want to learn from it? Uh, access to the content. That's it. Like, I mean, if you talk about like, what do you, what does it need? Like really need it, like you need to offer your stuff in a way that people can access it. So like, then what are your needs? I guess is the other side. Cause so that's pretty basic, right? So for them, they just need to have access and some way to, to kind of trot through it. So what do you need? Like as the person that's trying to deliver this to them, what, what are the essential features for you? So, so it, it sounds basic, but it enables you to do things like think about notion as a course hosting provider. Yeah. I'm a big fan. Right. Where like, okay, we're talking about my needs now. I need to be able to upload videos and I need to be able to do that in a way that isn't like, take me three hours or something like that. Cause like, that's awful. It needs to be able to like, I mean, that's it, right? You need to be able to upload your stuff and people need to be able to view it. That's the fundamental requirements of like a course platform. I think that for me, I want to be able to go beyond that. I want people to be able to like, for example, write rust and run tests on the website without having to install rust. And like, that's something that I can't get from Teachable. It's something I can't get from Podia, something I can't get from Notion or whatever, and it's a reason for building like a separate site, but like when it comes down to it, I don't think that anything really needs to be there other than the ability to like get the information there and the ability for people to like see the information. What about things like authorization and progress and collecting payments so you can pay the rent? I mean, all of that is dependent on like, what are you trying to achieve, right? Like you're talking about a course platform, not a subscription service that I can use to like fund everything for the year and whatnot, right? Like, do you need user accounts? Not if it's free, right? So like, it depends on what your course is, right? Is it a free leader to like other stuff that you're, then your platform is like super simple, right? It needs to be accessible. It needs to be like SEO oriented, right? And like those things change when you start thinking about how am I going to do a paid course platform or something like that, right? If you, I think you need to make decisions about like, okay, is what pieces of it is going to be accessible? Is this going to be able to hit Google at all, right? Like, is Google going to be able to bring people in for me? A lot of people just like ignore that question and default to no, right? Cause it's the easiest way to do it. At which point you need like user accounts, at which point you need like a payments and stuff, things like that, video playback is one that I'm using obviously, or I guess not obviously to listeners, but like, obviously to the person that I'm talking to on the podcast right now. I don't think that comments are like required. Cause I think that's supplemental to like, if you have a space for people to make comments like discord or something like that, you don't have to build that out, right? Like there's some sort of valve where they can go and interact with other people, maybe having a similar experience as them. Yeah. I mean, like that's a value add, if you can pull it off. Right. Not everybody wants to maintain a community. Not everybody wants to build a community. Not everybody wants to do like discord based support, stuff like that. Right. But like, if we're talking about all of the tools that you need to use to like actually build a course platform, you need to be able to respond to people's emails and you need to be able to accept payments and create user accounts. And the support load might be a big one that is often overlooked. Cause as soon as you start, I mean, exchanging products for dollars, right? Like at that point, people are going to have needs and you are going to want to meet them and especially if you're taking money, right? Like now you need to. Can you process a refund? For example, right? Like a rust adventure. I've been very lucky. It's been very successful. I've only had to process like two refunds, but I still had to process two refunds, right? Good average. I think actually that's a great metric. And I've heard this a lot, right? If you are seeing a lot of refunds, then it's like, you're either selling something and they don't understand what they're getting and it just doesn't match up to expectations. But when you, you know, like, I think that's a kudos for that. Cause that's a great metric. It's, it's one of the metrics that I think about and I'm like, yeah, most people buy the highest like version of rust adventure and I've only had to give two people refunds and like, I instantly do it, right? If somebody asked for a refund, I just give it to them. Like, there's no, like that whole aspect to it is just like, just give it. And then like, I'll, I'll ask them some questions and like, maybe they stick around and answer. Maybe they don't, but yeah. I mean, that's one of the things that I'm most sort of proud of in a way, because it means that people are buying it and then they're not looking at it and going, dang, I wish I didn't. Was there, was there anything surprising when you were building it? I know you're an extremely technical person. So, but at the same time, was, did anything kind of jump out either technically or otherwise when you were building your course delivery mechanism? How easy video was to get working. Yeah. Because the last time I seriously dealt with having to like do video was like probably flash era. It's come a long ways. Oh, and then like the HTML5 video element came around and then it really wasn't usable, right? Yeah. It's still not, it's not YouTube, right. Is the way that I'll put it. But it's something that like people have, there are players out there and there are services out there to deliver the video. And like, I didn't have to build the video delivery infrastructure. If I think if I had to build video delivery infrastructure, like, I don't know, RTMP shit or like something like that, that would have been like, Ooh, do I really want to do this? That would have been a moment at which like, okay, can I sacrifice like building my own thing and go like do something half on Teachable half somewhere else or something like that? Or like Teachable just uses Wistia. I've heard of Wistia. I have not used it. They're a delivery platform and they're basically marketing. And they actually, when we build Egghead, Chris, the CEO of Wistia is an amazing person and just gave it to us for free, which at the time video delivery was a real pain in the butt and it's improved a lot since then, but gave it to us for free. It's great. But like that's Teachable did not build their own video delivery infrastructure. That's the point, right? Like, and they're, they're a multi-billion dollar company and they did not. They avoided that sticky wicket and left it to, you know, people that are, it's like video delivery infrastructure, global CDNs and email. These are problems that I am super happy to allow companies to handle. I mean, if you ask me the set of technologies I'm using or like what I actually built, it's very small. Like it's probably smaller than you think it is. This is like, I want to hear that. Sure. The actual stuff that I actually built, I happened to have been building a framework myself for the past year or something called Toast. And I knew that what I wanted was to not have to worry about actively running servers as much as possible. So ton of it is just pre-rendered through Toast. And I use that for all of the content and stuff like that. You can get to all of the Rust adventure stuff via Google, all of the writing, all of the blog posts, all of the stuff like that, you cannot access the videos, but you can access all of the written content and like that's, short aside, that's really important to me. It's really important for me to like give access to people who actually need it and are willing to go through a little bit more effort to get at it. Speaking, you could probably get a lot of the information, if not most, just by, by spelunking and doing a little bit of legwork and discovering it in text form. So some, you lose some convenience, but the meat of it is still there. Yeah. I think for me, like the curation and all of that is like valuable to pay for. And like, if you want me to do more of it, like I need the money. So like at some point by it, but like, I remember being a young programmer or whatever, and not being able to afford any of this stuff. So like, it's really important to me to make it accessible to people who actually need it, even if it's not like everything, even if it's not like perfect, even if they don't have the user account or whatever. So it's basically all of that is statically rendered and just like up there. It's hard to get to. Also easier technically, right? Like you don't have to even think about how you're going to protect it or hide it or prevent people from sneaking glimpses. It's just like, it doesn't matter. It's just there. I had somebody submit, like to try to get a security bounty for like, Hey, we can access your content. And I was like, feature. So yeah, I mean, that's really all I built. And then I built some like serverless functions to handle various things. But like everything else is a Mux for video delivery. Mux is integration for video player and analytics and stuff like that. And then the payments are Stripe checkout. The user authentication is Cognito and stuff like that. So like there's like, I'm not building the infrastructure myself. I'm building the kind of like, kind of why I call it like a product and not like a platform that we were talking before, because it's a thing for me built on top of a bunch of platforms and infrastructure, right? Like AWS to me definitively platform, like it's powering so many other businesses. Right. So like I'm standing on top of those things and like the amount of stuff that I actually did for Rust Adventure, like I'm hosting all my repos on GitHub and they're all open source, by the way. So like, if you are a person who wants to dig and access the stuff, you can get access to the stuff. Like the code is there. All of the blog posts are even in the commits. So if you clone the repo, you get access. I recently saw somebody else on Twitter talking about like somebody tried to translate their course or whatever and posted a translation and they were like, can you take that down? And like, you know, like I would be concerned about that getting out of date and stuff and they're like, there are reasons that I would not want it spread around in the way that it's being spread around there, but like when it comes down to it, if it makes it more accessible to people, I think in the end it's all a positive because in the end people want to pay for content that helps them. People want to support people who are helping them get done what they need to get done with their life. I don't think that needs to be a thing that I need to worry about. Right. The occasional person who like might've would have paid for it, might get it like, oh, well, I'm still making plenty off of it. There's useful convenience to having the user account. There's useful convenience to getting access to the videos. There's useful convenience to me being able to continue to do this thing that you are benefiting from. And I think that drives basically everything about rest adventure at this point. The only line that we've ever drawn, cause it's just silly and it's hard to combat and, and often fruitless and frustrating. The only like, sometimes we'll get people wholesale uploading to YouTube and we make the effort to have that pulled down from YouTube because it feels like it should be free, like the people that are consuming it don't know that they're. Consuming it in a way that they shouldn't like pirate sites. I don't worry about cause everybody that's on a pirate site knows exactly what they're doing and they're not your customers anyway, so I don't really care what you're doing cause you're just stealing from yourselves. But like when it goes up on YouTube wholesale, I'm like, okay, well I'll do the, I have a script that builds the spreadsheet that YouTube requires to have that sort of thing removed. And that is, that's like the line for me, but like there's, you know, like I agree with you, like if somebody is doing a translation, maybe can I just pay you for that and we'll put it on the official channels, like that sort of thing. Right. Like that. And then I find a way to keep it updated or something rather than have it go out of date and whatnot. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, like this is a need that people have, so maybe we can just service that need instead of, of fighting it or wanting it to go away. I think the, the really easy example of this that I just saw recently is Nintendo just took down, I don't know, a bunch of stuff off of one of these like music re-upload channels for like Mario Kart theme songs and stuff like that, but they don't have it up on their own channel, so nobody can listen to it. Right. Like that to me is the line. Like if you're going to re-upload it, well, I mean, like if it's all of my stuff is on YouTube anyway, you can go through and view all of like the early content, early versions of the content, all of the stuff as I was figuring everything out, it's all on YouTube. It's all freely available. It's all there. Yeah. I mean, like I stream a lot of it. Right. So like, I don't know. I would prefer people get it from the source that like people credit me and stuff like that. That's kind of what I care about. Like I did the stuff and don't re-upload it under your name and then not let it get back to me. Like don't cut me out of the equation and then try to resell it. That's a line for me. But like, but I want people to have access. It's important. I think we, we share that desire. This is the last question. And I'm curious what your answer will be. Do you have any audacious goals in terms of, of your teaching or course development or the course delivery mechanisms that you have employed? Audacious goals. Like I said, I have some stuff that I'm working on currently where you will be able to like run Rust on the site in the course to like do that language level kind of stuff. Oh, cool. You can't really do that for like CLIs and stuff. I mean, like you could, but like, it doesn't have the same impact. Like you can't run a game on the website through compiling it for somewhere else or whatever. It doesn't really make sense to do that. But for like Rustlings, like almost exorcism-y type stuff, like language levels, syntax, and small exercise, those are all going to be like, you can write some Rust in the browser and run it and run the tests and get the feedback. Building that? Yes. That is a thing that I currently have in prototype mode. So that should be coming at some point. It'll probably come out like as I start shipping the language stuff on the site. Right now, a lot of the language level content is going to YouTube because I have ideas of how it should be presented, but I want to make sure that they are the ones that should go into the workshop on the site and that's going to be like free leader content because I don't think that the language level stuff, I think there's so much language level stuff for Rust out there that it doesn't really make sense for me to like charge for that. But it makes a lot of sense for me to like have that be a thing. Right. It's your perspective and it'll be like a direct conduit into like, this is how we are going to do things here. So you can, it's like a primer at that point, I would think. Yeah, for sure. And then there's also like, I don't just do Rust, right? And like, I never really have just done JavaScript either. And I have wider vision around like, yeah, so I do a bunch of serverless stuff for Rust, but if I have already done all of the instructional design for like the serverless side of it, then it's less work for me to do that also for JavaScript or something, right? Like something else I have expertise in. So when you have a serverless course on the market, will you then have a platform? I'm just teasing, call it what you will, it's fine. I really appreciate it, Chris. Thanks for sharing your experience and I think it's great what you're doing. It sounds like if people are interested in Rust, following you on YouTube would probably be a really good idea. And then maybe exploring Rust adventures. Thanks again. Yeah. Thanks for having me.

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey Mark. Hi Joel. I'm really interested to talk to you because one, I think you approach teaching a little differently than I do. And you also are kind of in a different subject area than I'm usually used to. Cause we kind of do the front-ended egghead and that's like, that's where I live is kind of in that vicinity and that's been my career, so I'm really kind of, kind of stoked to, to learn more about your process and what you. Do to approach the subject matter that you teach. The first thing I wanted to kick off with though, is how do you personally approach a new complex subject? When you sit down to learn something new, what's your strategy when you're learning? Yeah, I have a pretty flushed out process at this point. My first step is I really just want to find out as much as I can about. The specific topic that I want to teach. So it's, I call it like the fun step where I'm just learning as much as I can. I'm trying to find information on blogs or documentation, and I'm just getting as much info as I can and I'm dumping it back out into my own kind of subject matter material where I can then reference when I am creating the material. So this helps kind of get familiar with the topic if you're, if I'm not familiar with it at all, or I just, I can kind of deep dive into the topic without worrying too much about what I'm going to teach you. Do you approach, okay. So if you're not going to teach it, right. Like if you're learning something or is it the same for you? Like, right. Like if you're going to sit down and just learn something for yourself or learn some sort of technology that you want to use personally, or do you, when you sit down to, to learn something, do you have that, I'm going to teach this mindset in your head? I pretty much know the topic I'm going to teach before I get started. But when I'm learning, if I'm learning something on my, for my own skills, it seems like I tried to get things working quicker and like real implementation. But when I'm creating the course, I just want to deep dive and more so read about everything and get all the, get all the info together first before creating something, which is interesting. It's kind of, so when you're building for you, it's like for yourself, you'll get in there and rough it out or build something and kind of get your hands dirty and approach it that way. Versus trying to get all the information and as much background as possible, because you plan on teaching this and that backgrounds more necessary when you're teaching a topic. Yeah. And it gets, I think it gives you a more general sense of everything that you're going to learn as well, rather than just maybe siloed into a specific thing that you're just trying to get working. Yeah. Trying to get it done. When you think about what makes a good course, what does that look like to you? What are the components of a good online course? Components of a course, I try to establish what the transformation of the course is going to be upfront. So defining that, who the course is for, almost like a persona. So once I have that, then I can focus on, I try to just make a transition for the person that's taking the course. So I think a good course just gets, it takes a really complex topic or complex subject and just breaks it down into really simple lessons. That's why I was attracted to egghead long time ago, where you have these small bite-sized lessons, right? And they're just very easy to learn. Cause you're not kind of scattered and trying to teach five things at once. You're just trying to teach one little concept at a time. It's just much easier to get across. When somebody first interacts with your courses in general, what's the, what are they trying to achieve? Have you noticed any particular pattern in either in their professional or their personal lives? Like why are people, you know, skilling up in the subjects that you teach? I work pretty strictly in Magento topic, which is an e-commerce framework that's currently managed by Adobe. And it's an extremely hard platform to learn. You can think of, I remember back in the day, trying to learn like sugar CRM. That was another PHP base, just extremely complex content management system. And Magento is kind of similar to that, where there's just so much to learn. So the courses, it's a hard subject to teach because of that too, because there's just so many topics. So mostly I see just everyone trying to learn the fundamentals and become efficient and productive at something. It's, and there's different topics. So maybe someone wants to learn specifically how to theme something. So that's, you know, that's a whole topic in itself and their end goal is to be able to create something for a client and just know what they're doing without guessing and copying pasting things from Stack Overflow. So yeah, just more so understanding the topic. To what extent is it important to understand those goals, what they're trying to achieve when you sit down to design a new course or teach something? Well, I, they pretty much want an entire course on the entire subject as much as possible. So it's, it comes down to fleshing out all that material and just having all of those little nuances or tricks. And I have a lot of people that also want to learn how things are done, not or why things are done, not how they're done. So there's a lot of that explaining why you do things a certain way, as opposed to some other way. Is there a difference like in your approach when you teach somebody the why versus how, like how does that differ in terms of maybe how you design or how you approach the teaching process? Yeah, it's very different. So when you're trying to teach how to do something, it's more like a reference course of here's how to do this, here's how to do that. And there's not too much, there's not too much explanation going on within the lessons of the course. It's, they tend to be shorter and straight to the point. And that's how a lot of courses are. But when you start teaching the why, it's much harder to dig into the code and cause you have to understand it first yourself of why things are done. And that's sometimes the hardest part where you have to learn it better than, you know, you've known it before. So to teach something, it's, it's really different from, from learning it on your own because you have to explain it, be able to explain things. Do you have a, like a instructional design framework or philosophy that you use, or is this something that you've kind of developed over time just through practice? Yeah, I just created it myself. I've noticed it align with some other processes that are out there though, that are really similar and, you know, there's books on how to get things done or how to focus on something. And they seem to kind of correlate with the steps that I take to create a course. So that learning, that learning document and dump out is sort of the step one. And then I get into actually coding up like a working demo. Then I move on to defining, Hey, what's this course gonna, what's it going to be named? What's a general outline of the course. And then I focus into kind of taking that demo code that I really didn't, it's not supposed to be an end product. And I work it into actually creating more of a formalized, this is what we will be creating in the course. And then I kind of refine that, that demo material and organize how to build things and in what order. I think the order that you teach things is so important, especially with a complex topic. And then I get into just outlining the actual lessons and the kind of the final curriculum. And the easiest part is the recording and the editing, I think. So after I kind of get everything transformed to outlines and all of the content sort of established of what I'm going to teach, the recording kind of takes care of itself. Is that, I mean, it feels to me like that's because you've done a lot of research and you're comfortable and understand because of the foundations that you've kind of built for yourself. Yes. So these steps, yeah. So the steps kind of overlay on each other and to code up a working demo is something you have to be familiar with the material and kind of, that's kind of what you learn in that document and dump stage. And then same thing with converting an outline into lessons. Well, once you've code coded a demo and then perhaps refined it into a working version, you're already familiar with that. So yeah, it definitely, this framework definitely makes things easier. And I noticed after a few, about three courses, I need some kind of process to create something. Cause I didn't have anything when I started and I just needed a repeatable process to make sure I can deliver these on time and of high value. One of my jokes I like is if you're not using a framework, you're inventing. And if you keep inventing a framework over and over again, instead of even developing your own, like that's where the demons lie for me. Right? Like, it's like there has to be some sort of process. It doesn't have to be super rigid, but some sort of process to get like consistent and just repeatable results over time. Yeah. And yeah, I noticed when I deviate from this process to it, it seems to linger off or not, things don't get done quite as efficiently because you're kind of lost in that process of how to create a final working version of that course. I'm curious when you're thinking about the example space and I think it's really important, right? Like it's important what you are teaching because it needs to be relevant and how do you balance kind of the messy, repetitive, you know, frustrating hair pulling real world, right? Like of software development with the example space and kind of basically the lab sanitized version of that. How do you balance those for your learners? It's very hard. So I have pretty much foundational fundamental courses that I've been working on. So but I'm kind of at the point where I have a lot of the foundational and fundamental things done. And now I think it would make sense to break off of that and create courses that are purely building a certain module. Now you're using all of the concepts that you learned in the fundamentals and foundation courses and you don't have to worry about explaining all of those topics in detail because they're explained in that other course. So I think focusing on those real life examples is important because that's what everyone wants to know at the end of the day. But you can't learn that without the fundamentals first. So, yeah, do you see a lot of people coming in there wanting to solve something specific or they have got a new gig and are overwhelmed or how does that all the time? Yeah. And a lot of times I can't even answer it because I don't know the answer. It's just things take a lot of time and research. Yeah. So people want to skip past the fundamentals and get right to the gravy bits. Oh, yeah. You know, like, like, oh, I just wish I could inject those fundamentals and be done with it. But it doesn't work like that, right? Like, yeah, Adobe has their Adobe commerce certifications. And I don't know how many times I've heard from so many people. They want to get certified and they don't know the fundamentals or they're just they just heard of Magento a few weeks ago. It's like, well, it'll take about six months to a year to get certified and get alert, start off with the fundamentals and work your way through it. And then, you know, I usually don't hear anything back after. But it's definitely people want to skip steps. And you feel like you're competing with the official documentation, their learning resources for the platform, or how does that work out for you when you are going against a juggernaut like Adobe? Are they not focused on it the same way? I'm I don't really see it as competing because my content is so different from theirs. They have their subscription that's very expensive. So there's that that huge price gap for one. And of course, they're known, though. So that's one of the hardest problems is just getting known and getting your name out there. But yeah, I sort of do things my own way. So in a way, I don't really feel like I'm competing. I don't feel like anyone can really compete with me of how I'm exactly creating these courses. They might create their own Magento courses, but that's completely different in their way of teaching things. So, yeah, it's I have my own niche for sure. It sounds like there's plenty of room in the space. Yeah, it's a big market, even though it's been around for a while and there's actually not too many individual course graders on this topic. So there's definitely a huge space. Yeah. And of course, the whole price component of Adobe subscription versus your own pricing. So how do you pick an example? Like when you what is how do you come up with what to teach in terms of the pure example space? I was taking kind of random suggestions from people and then going and building that. But that's a really good question, because it's so hard to determine what to build next, because I want to at this point, I want to affect as many subscribers as I can. I pretty much work off of subscriptions. So learning all of those fundamental courses in a specific order is very important. Yeah, I've done random topics and they've just bombed. But I've done topics that it's funny, I've surveyed people on and social media and everything and topics that they didn't want at all on social media. I wound up doing very well as sold courses because that's just what real people that are subscribing and learning want. Yeah, I think there's some danger in surveying and kind of getting the voice like that voice. Right. Like versus like people often say one thing, but actually want or need something totally different. Right. Like, oh, that sounds really fun. I want to do that. But fun isn't necessarily what you need. Right. Like what you need is to get in there and shoulder in and plow the field. Yeah, I've done I've asked those same questions to my paid subscribers. It's funny. And the answers are completely different of what you what they want next. So it's it's kind of funny. Yeah. And I think that's interesting, too, like the just free, you know, like people in the free wild versus paying customers and kind of what their opinions will be, how they'll treat the product, you know, like when you give away something like if you do a workshop and it's free, then you're doing a webinar versus if you charge and then people actually show up and they're engaged, right? Like that kind of balance between like who you're listening to and who you're catering to. And generally speaking, the paying customers, the winner there in my book, I thought you you mentioned that you are running on subscriptions, but then you also offer a la carte pricing so you can go in and purchase courses individually or you can purchase a subscription or you can purchase a lifetime pass. And I'm wondering, like what went into your thought process for coming? Like, how am I going to sell this and how am I going to price it and how am I going to divvy this up and offer people? And what is the it sounded like the subscriptions are the revenue driver, but what ended up being the winner? Yeah, they both do well. Even the individual subscriptions have been even picking up lately. It's funny. But so I started off just with one course was Magento Fundamentals course. And it's I have one course, so there's no reason for a subscription. Things went pretty well, sold really well and started getting asked about the front end of Magento JavaScript layer. So I created a course on that. And it's funny, as soon as I released that second course, I already had users asking me for a subscription that they can subscribe because if I planned on creating more courses and after that third course, I actually launched a subscription already. And I was I didn't think anyone would subscribe because I only have three courses, but it actually kind of picked off and it's it hasn't stopped since. So kind of just listen to customer as far as what to charge for the individual courses. I sort of picked it off in there. I just had to start with something and I definitely focus on premium courses at the moment. And I wanted something different from Udemy. That's 10, you know, 80 hour course. And so I did something that it's 999 this week, Mark. What was that? That Udemy course is 999 this week. Yeah, exactly. And I can't control that. Yeah. They're going to randomly mark it down 90 percent. So definitely focus on the premium side. And after a ton of research from I use Teachable and they have a lot of great blog articles of how to price your course and value pricing. And I definitely value price all my courses and my offerings. Probably not enough even. But yeah, it's pricing's always been difficult. But I think the market, like the programming course market, is grossly undercharging just for the like the value, right? Like what you can get if you learn these skills and, you know, the developer salaries and where it can take you in a very short amount of time if you shouldering and do the work. And people are, you know, it's like they're charging two, three hundred dollars for, you know, a very full featured course. And I'm like, I don't know, like I feel like that's an order of magnitude too low. And then I'm wondering what what is like an eight thousand dollar programming course look like, right? Like if you take it an order of magnitude above that or, you know, like a multiplier up. And what do you have to do to produce something like that is an interesting question. What do you think? What would it take to to have something at even a higher level, right? Like another multiplier up? Yeah, I'd love to sell an eight thousand dollar course. Yeah. What does that look like? What does that look like for a programming course? I've actually talked to a course, kind of a course coach at Session. That was one of their suggestions was you don't have a high ticket item. I do sell my my subscription as a lifetime one time payment. That's a multiple subscription. But it's still apparently I'm still missing a high ticket item. And right now at the moment, that plays into more cohort based courses. It's hands on, right? And like it's you and your time or you or your whoever that is, right? Like it's you and then some sort of person. Yeah. And it's yeah. And it's interesting. I've been constantly thinking about it and I'm very protective of my time, though. So that's what's why I haven't done it yet. I'm still trying to work out how that would look and work. If that would be viable. Right now, I'm completely autonomous with my time. I can take weeks off. Everything still runs itself. So once you have that cohort based course, even if it's just, you know, two to four weeks, it's still a commitment. You have to show up like you can't. You know, they paid you and basically have a contract at that point. So you well, and then you I mean, you're teaching them and you just have to show up. Right. That's part of the deal. And that's the hard part. I think it's interesting. You know, you're a developer. And one of the inclinations for developers is to start from scratch and well develop. Right. Like when people say, hey, what does it take to be a developer? And it's like, well, you develop software. That's pretty much what it takes. And I think it's interesting that, you know, like you stopped short of the delivery platform, right? Like you said, you're using teachable. And I'm wondering, you know, what was that a debate in your head? Did you think about building your own thing or was it like straight to like what's the best decision for me right now to deliver? It's funny because I do have that developer mindset. I want to build everything. But I think over the years, I sort of slowly trained myself in the like fit gap analysis because we did it for clients with Magento sites where, hey, what's the build versus buy? And there's a module out there that does this. And if it does it, 90 percent should absolutely just buy it because it's not worth the time. So when it came time to selling my first course, I actually didn't even think about creating my own platform. I've seen people that have built their own platforms. And then at least initially, all of their work is on supporting that course platform rather than delivering the material and the content that is really why they're doing it. So it's yeah, I figured at some point I'll eventually probably build my own if something else just doesn't come up and present itself. But yeah, it's more of like, do I want to deliver content, course content to my subscribers or am I focused on building this course platform? And that build versus bad mentality is very, very important to me. And is it worth it? And it has to be really worth it for me to conduct something like that. What do you think you might be missing out on by using Teachable? Right now, Teachable's great. Provide me for a living as a living. So can't complain much about that. But the almost a lot of my a lot of big portion of my business is subscriptions. And there's subscriptions definitely lack where a user can't go and downgrade their account to another platform. They can for my teams. They can automatically go ahead and subscribe multiple members and then assign it themselves and manage all those users. Yeah, there's upgrading, downgrading accounts, prorating the account. So when someone let's say they only want to go another three months, they can't like automatically cancel for three months or something like that. And credits to subscriptions with. You're triggering me a little bit because I do build a platform and all of this stuff is stuff that I've like consciously actually built and like think about. And then and it's funny because I look at other platforms and what they lack and then like the things that I've like, like bit my nails over the years and made sure that they were just right and implemented. And then, yeah, I don't know. Like it's always a balance, right? Like when you're developing. But I don't know. It's interesting to me. That's a big balance. And something I forgot about just remember now is like that and taxes or is becoming very important. I'm coming from an e-commerce space and I've seen tons of businesses get completely fined and attacked from the tax purpose that they weren't taxing and submitting and remaining properly. So that's a big that's a very important part of me. And Teachable does take care of all of that for me. If I was all based in the U.S. and selling U.S. customers, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But big international following, it's if submit to multiple countries, it's. Have you seen somebody, a U.S. citizen in the U.S. based business actually receive fines from a European entity and then have that enforced and actually have to pay them? I haven't. And that's the argument. Yeah, it's yeah. And it's I know a lot of business people and I hear people talk about that a lot and worried about European regulations. And if I was if I lived in the U.K. or Germany, that's exactly what I would do. I wouldn't. Yeah, if I was there, I'd be like, well, the U.S. doesn't exist. And here I'm like, well, yeah, I think at the very least. I'm in the U.S., so I need to charge sales tax to U.S. customers for sure. But there's even loopholes around that with live elements. And it gets really interesting, especially even with VAT tax. One thing I've noticed about in my experience is it's strictly in the U.S. and with dealing with U.S. states is they're very quick to send you a letter when you owe them money. They are very quick. The federal government and state governments and even local governments, if you owe them money and you are required to pay them, they let you know, like like across the board. They let you know, hey, you live here and they'll overestimate what you owe them to. So it's like, oh, hold on. I don't know you that much. Let's actually do the math here and figure that out. It's a real chore. Like it's one of my least favorite things. And I think about sometimes this idea, if I had to globally handle paperwork, I would literally just get a job. Yeah, yeah. No, thanks. Like, I'm out. I can't do it. No, that's what I was always worried. You know, I depend on this for my livelihood, too. And if they ever if I ever got attacked from a European enemy, you owe me, you know, twenty thousand dollars and it happened multiple times or just something random. It would it could take me out. So well, and I mean, I just don't think it's realistic, right? Like like this idea of like if the U.S. was going into different countries and saying you owe us money, like it just doesn't. It would, you know, globalism exists. But, you know, like if all the hundreds of countries on the planet were all trying to like get at each other citizens to pay and follow their regulations, it would just be like this utter chaos and nobody would be able to do business whatsoever. I get it. Like if, you know, like Amazon and Google, like but they have entities, they have literal offices and divisions in these countries and they have to comply. I don't know what's the whole. And even with that, there is actually footnotes in there that I don't think anyone reads that if they don't pay that on something or someone isn't charging them, they're supposed to self-pay that. Yeah, yeah, it's nice. I have never gotten a sales bill or anything is teachable does that for me. So it's yeah, that is a nice thing with the platform. And I don't know, like Stripe is doing that. And there's other services that I don't particularly care for. So I'll mention them. That'll just completely take care of that across the board, too. So there's a lot of help out there for doing these things is advancing that as well. I have a feeling they're going to build that in tax remittance very soon. Yeah, it's a competitive feature. I think people want to do it. So they're going to build it in. What's your do you have like as a course producer and a teacher and a developer, do you have any sort of audacious goals or big plans that you're working on? Not yet. At this point, it's just making as much content as I can. That's been the number one. I have six premium courses. So on a subscription, it's tough to get people to resubscribe. It could be at points. So definitely creating as much content as I can is my number one priority right now. Do you fold any sort of community aspect into it? I have. I use actually Circle as a pretty good integration with Teachable, with Auth integration. So I use it's pretty new, but it's been working out great. They have Webhooks, full API, so I can when someone purchases a course, I can tag them and do all sorts of cool things in Circle. But yeah, it's been working out really well. Nice. Love it. Well, Mark, it's great talking to you. I appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. I look forward to seeing your continued success and setting a kind of a good example for course producers, both in quality, but then also charging based on the value of your work and what you're delivering to people. I really respect that you've upped that a little bit, I feel. And I like to see that and I want to see more of that. So I appreciate it. Thanks, Joel. Cheers. Thanks. Great to be here. It was nice chatting with you.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"You've built something very cool with CSS for JS devs, you built your own platform, you designed and released a course that lots of people have used and loved, and you're selling that online. But first I want to ask you, and I've seen you talk about this before, and it's always fascinating to me, how people learn new complex subjects. What is your approach when you're digging in and learning something? And I know recently you've done that with like 3D graphics, right? How do you think about, you know, like a new challenging topic to get in there and learn it quickly and efficiently? Yeah. I mean, that's always the hardest is when you're starting something right at the beginning, cause you don't know what you don't know yet, right? You don't even know where to start sometimes. I don't know that I have any grand strategies. I think that when I'm starting something new, there's really no choice, but to find some sort of tutorial or video or course, right, something that kind of walks you through those early steps. So I'll go and find that, like with 3D modeling, I just spent a lot of time on YouTube, right? 3D modeling is one of those things that video is a really good format for it because for anyone that's ever opened Blender or a similar 3D rendering application, it's just buttons everywhere. It's like the cockpit of a plane. And so it's not the kind of thing you can jump in and just start experimenting with and a text-based article would need to have so many screenshots. So, you know, I kind of thought, okay, video makes sense for this. Let me watch some video. And then once I started getting my bearings, I would try to like extend what I've learned or do something similar, right? So if you follow a tutorial that has you build like a little motorcycle, see if I can make like a bicycle or a car, right, something that's in the same, mind you, all three of those things would be very complex, so not really super beginner friendly, but yeah, essentially just try and switch the balance so that, because I feel like there's limited utility in watching someone do something, right. Or even doing the same thing that person is doing, right. Kind of copy pasting, or not copy pasting, but just like recreating their exact motions, right. That's a very good way to learn how to, yeah. Like it teaches you how to do the specific thing that you're watching the video for, but then when you try to apply those skills to something similar, you realize very quickly, like, oh, I haven't actually learned the general skill of 3D modeling. I've learned how to build this object and that object. You've learned how to make a donut. Right. Yeah. So it's a matter of trying to find that balance of starting by watching passive content and then more and more. And by, you know, once you get to a certain point, like now with 3D modeling, and I'm still pretty much a beginner, like I don't know enough to do a lot of things, but I know enough to build a handful of objects. And so most of my time now is just, I have this, like, let me see if I can model something on my desk or some like idea that I have in my head. And I think it's fantastic that you have that capability. I was a 3D modeler in my previous career. And it's funny because just that particular topic at that time, it was literally, you went to Barnes and Noble and you bought the new writer's book and you went through and it was screenshots and it was all step-by-step. And I think it's really fantastic that we have this capability in these courses and we don't have to go to school and do that necessarily. We can, but we have so many options available. What do you think, like, if you're thinking about a course or, you know, courses in general, what are the qualities of a really good course in your experience? Yeah. So my own philosophy around this is that, actually two things I want to talk about. Sure. One is that it's really important to be entertaining and for the person to be enjoying it. I think that's why so many courses have such low completion rates is that if it's just like a slog to get through, then it's really hard to have the self motivation. Right. It's not like when you're in school and there's external pressures on you. In most cases, you buy a course, unless maybe like your employer buys it for you and there's an expectation there. Most of the time, it's just, you want to learn a thing, you buy the course, and now it's on you to do this thing. And trying to keep it like kind of fun and lightweight, that's really important. The other thing, and we kind of alluded to this a little bit already, is to try to make sure that there's an element of active practice, right? So it shouldn't be that the person can watch the course on their phone. Like I do like the idea of making things accessible to people who only have phone, but unless you're opening a code editor on your phone and actually trying things out, right, it shouldn't be that passive. There can be passive elements. So my course has something like 170 videos. So there's plenty of video, but those videos are sprinkled between other bits of content where it's like, here's an exercise and critically, the exercises aren't just do the thing that I just did. It's build this slightly different thing. I'm trying to incorporate some of that active learning where I'll show you A, B, and C, and I'll ask you to do D, right? Like there's a little bit of an extension that goes beyond what we've covered. Do you give away the answer to those? Or is it always, because you know, like one of the challenges in book learning, right, like when you're reading a technical book, they'll always have the now do this section at the end, which is, is always the hardest, right? If you don't truly understand something and you encounter that, it's like, Oh my gosh, I don't even know how to do this. Do I read the chapter again? Or, you know, like how do I do that? And I'm wondering, you know, like how, at what point do you release somebody into the wild to learn their own, you know, without the support structure of, you know, like, just do what I tell you, right? And I think that's what we're saying, right? Like there's like, follow the directions. Just like I tell you, now you've built that thing. Now build this slightly different thing. And, you know, is there a balance between the guide rails, I suppose? Yeah. So in my own case, every exercise will have a solution video. And what I tell people is take five or 10 minutes on this thing. And it's totally okay if you can't figure it out in that time. One of the things, actually, the first lesson in my course is all about trying to get people to have the right mindset. Cause so many people, myself included, like I'm not exempt from this. You want to be good at something and you don't want to struggle and you want to just glide through it, right? You want to be the genius that figures things out right away. You don't want to be the person that's kind of struggling through something. But the only way to learn something effective is to struggle. Like the only, we learn so much more from failing at something than we do from succeeding effortlessly. And so if we can change our mindset, if I spend 10 minutes on this and I make some progress, but I don't get the right answer, that is still like an incredible success because you've learned more than you knew 10 minutes ago, right? You experimented, you made a couple of connections in your mind, then you watch the video and that fills in the rest of the blanks, right? Again, I want it to be fun. I don't want it to be punishing where it's like, here's this massively difficult problem that I've given you very little guidance for. And now you're on your own. So I still want to make sure that people are encouraged, that it's totally fine. I also say that like, I have this kind of idealized version of how this should go where you try the exercises, you give it five, 10 minutes, you watch the video. But I make clear, like, this is your course. Like I'm not looking over your shoulder, trying to make sure that you're doing it properly. If you want to watch the solution video first, go ahead. I don't think it's quite as effective, but ultimately it's a lot more effective than getting frustrated and never touching the course again. So it's like all carrot, no stick at that point, right? Like you can literally push the button and just watch the video, but you are doing nothing but kind of taking away from ultimately your own learning experience, unless you already got it and you're just reviewing and at the end of the day. And that's really none of our business. That's your business, right? Yeah. And this is something I've actually had to learn a little bit because you mentioned, right, before I did this, I was developing curriculum for Concordia bootcamps, which is a local coding bootcamp. And in the coding bootcamp, people have paid like over $10,000 and they're committed to this thing. Right. And so you can lean a little bit more into the, like, having it be a little bit more frustrating, trying to optimize for effect rather than just like it being really fun and lightweight because the, you know, obviously you still don't want it to be miserable, you never want it to be miserable, but it's okay to allow like 20 minutes of struggling instead of five minutes, because you know that the person isn't going to abandon the program based on that and it's going to be more effective, but ultimately it is about finding the right balance. I think there's always a balance between the kind of direct support, you know, like you might have in a classroom style environment versus this idea of a self-paced course, so the balance even gets a little trickier when you're talking about that, I would suspect. Yeah, that's a good point because it's true that in our bootcamp, we had people, myself included, a lot of the time on hand to help people when they got stuck, which I try to make available to a degree in the course. Right. We have a discord community. People are encouraged to ask questions, but I'm not there 24 seven. I have hired someone that's there part-time to help out as well, but you know, it's not the same where you're not going to be able to get someone immediately in like a one-on-one dialogue to be able to walk through problems. You have to be a little bit more generous with what you share so that people can unstick themselves a little bit more easily. I think it's interesting too, because the price point is different, right? Like if you were there full-time and it was you providing that service, like you would have to, you know, like the price would have to be much more expensive and then not be as inclusive overall, and so there's all sorts of challenges. I also think that there's an interesting idea of like what fun is, because to me, fun is really kind of elusive and a lot of times fun means that there's a little suffering, that anxiety, like excitement and anxiety, right, are very closely aligned as emotions and feelings. So what is fun and how do you introduce that into like a learning experience? Yeah. And there's also just the dopamine hit of struggling with something and then the light bulb goes off and it's like, Oh, like now I get it. Right. And it's harder to have those moments, or at least those moments aren't as impactful if it was immediately obvious to you, or you just watched a video and let that moment absorb the very concrete thing that I'm teaching, but miss the kind of broader connections to the other stuff we've been teaching or learning. So you built your own course platform and I think that's awesome. It's something that I've done too. And it's like, I wouldn't recommend it unless you really want to, and you did really want to. And I'm wondering why, like what, what didn't exist for you and why did you need to build your own platform? Yeah. So the honest answer to this, there's like a half honest answer. I'll give you that one first. Yeah. Let's hear it. Which is that in my blog, right, I have this blog, it uses MDX. And I found it really useful to be able to embed whatever I want, right? If I can think of something, if I can build it with JavaScript and react or any other technology, I can just drop it into the middle of my blog post. So an example is I have a blog post on spring physics. It's one thing to describe spring physics, right? It's very hard in words, easier with like a video. You can watch the spring bounce back and forth, but even better if I can have a little handle that someone can drag and release and notice how that effect changes depending on how far they drag the handle, right? Being able to interact with it. And that's not something I think really exists in, especially not if you go the like commercial route of course platforms that are intended for non-developers. Right. There's kind of this growing movement of developer focused platforms, and maybe that will be able to let you do that. But certainly when I was starting my course platform, I couldn't think of anything else that could do that. Now that's the semi-honest answer. The fully honest answer is I just wanted to build my own course platform. The sheer challenge of it, like you want to sit out and have full control and build your own space on the internet. I'm a bit of a perfectionist. And I just, I knew that it, I wasn't going to be able to tweak anything off the shelf to be what I wanted it to be in terms of aesthetic and polish and feel. It's also a matter of, I like developing and this is even true to this day, right? I'm still, I'm working on my second course now and I bounce between building content and building, working on the platform and that kind of variety makes it much easier to sustain the energy to do this long-term I think, because it's not just 24 seven content creation. I'm able to do a bit of content and then mix things up and add some cool platform feature that I've wanted to exist. So I think having that just as a developer that what, other than my blog, I don't have any other major projects right now. I wanted to make sure that I still had that. Yeah. If you're consulting or working, you know, like on a job and a, at a service company as a developer, then you're constantly developing, but then at the same time, you're not getting the outlet of the content and do you actively balance that? Is that something that you consciously think about or is it just as you feel or what needs to get done? How are you balancing the platform versus the course content creation? Yeah, there's definitely some amount of structure. So one example is Fridays are my do what I want day. It's like kind of like my day off, but it's usually I'll pick some fun tasks to work on. Like 20% time ish kind of, kind of. Yeah, exactly. And it's almost always something whimsical with the platform. So it might be like a fancy invitation flow or like the, for people who have seen screenshots of my course platform, there's these like connecting, I call them bridges between lessons in a given thing. And they kind of swoop around. That was like a fun, a fun Friday project where there are things that I can't really justify otherwise in terms of like, will this help me sell more courses? Probably not. Will this make the education process that much better? Probably not, but it does incrementally have an impact. And when you take them in aggregate, right, when you have five or 10 of these things, they really do create a much better user experience. So that's like the organized part, but a lot of it is like, as you're going through the content, especially in my platform, because there's kind of a blurry line between content and platform. So one example is that I have these, like, I call them mini games. Really? They're more like quizzes, but they have kind of novel input mechanisms. So one of them is I'm trying to teach you the terminology in CSS. What's a declaration? What's a property? And rather than like, have this just be a multiple choice thing, I show you some CSS and ask you to select the appropriate subsection of that, just with the way you would select text on the web, right? Drag and select some chunk of it. And so that was the kind of thing where I had this content idea that then required a platform component of, Oh, I need a mini game component and I need to handle this special input thing and I need to create, like, cause you know, not everyone can select, you have to have a lot of dexterity and a pointer device. So there is like a fallback where you can just kind of type in the part of the code that is applicable and all that stuff takes a lot of time. So often, Sure, especially if you're considering accessibility and you know, like you're going to have one way you do this, but maybe they need keyboard entry or lots of people want to, you know, so you are capturing the most and making sure everybody can participate. Yeah. And it is the only thing I haven't done really well, at least not yet, is in terms of screen reader support, right? So I do assume that you can see the screen. And a lot of that is that I'm building a CSS course and I am not skilled enough to know how to teach CSS without a visual aid, right? So much of it is just, here's a mock-up and design it or implement this design. But in terms of a touch control, right? In terms of motor control, when I was starting to build the platform, I actually couldn't use a keyboard or mouse. I was having some nerve issues. So in fact, even the first bit of the platform in the first game was developed without those tools. So of course I needed to make sure that they were usable without those tools. And it's just, it's been something that I've tried to keep up with as well as I can, but you don't need a mouse. You don't need a touchscreen or a trackpad, right? If you have a keyboard, you should be able to do everything that you need on the platform. That's cool. You mentioned mini games and this has come up a lot as I've talked to people about course platforms and instructional design. And I'm wondering how, are you a gamer and has that affected your instructional design philosophy? Yeah. I mean, I am a gamer. I do, you know, it's, I don't think the games in my platform are going to win any like game awards. No, that's not their point. Yeah. But it is just a matter of let's take something, especially when I have something that's a little bit dry and I think I can make it a lot like terminology and CSS, right? Like it's one of the most dull things you can imagine, but you wrap it in the kind of, I don't know, no analogy comes to mind, but you deliver it in this mechanism and suddenly it's not so dull. Like it's a little bit more interesting to learn about the difference between a declaration and a property and a style, right? Like it, it just makes it a little more interesting. And I think part of it too is novelty, right? Like, and I've tried to make sure that the games themselves are like actually effective and the whole thing isn't just about novelty and not just there's eye candy or whatever, it's all, it's all there for a purpose at the end of the day. But there is something to be said for the novelty of, oh, this is interesting, right? I've never seen this before. Not only because it makes the course more enjoyable, but it makes the content more memorable. So it actually, I think makes it more effective if it's something new and interesting and different and that I think that sticks with people a little more. I know for sure. Like I've, I've read white papers and research that, that while people are learning, occasionally you have to shake them up, right? Like if you drone on and on for three hours with same tone and cadence, like you're just going to lose people. Or if it's an online course, if it's the same thing over and over again, if there's no surprise at all, people just aren't as likely to engage. And I don't think completion rates are super important, but it is right. Like getting people through it, if you want them to leave, cause they've learned what they came to learn, not because they got bored and just like, like petered out of the whole thing, I think. Yeah. And that is something that I was trying to be conscious of too. You know, I used to work at Khan Academy and one of the things I learned at Khan Academy is that when Sal Khan, the founder was starting, you know, it started as a YouTube channel, it's since developed into a much broader platform. But YouTube at the time had a 10 minute video limit. That's how long your videos could be. And so we kind of had to find a way to take these somewhat complex, like mathematical topics and break them into 10 minute videos, and it wound up really working to his favor because it's hard to watch a video for more than 10 minutes. Like that turns out to be a decent increment where you can watch it for 10 minutes and take a break before the next one. And you know, the fancy terminology that I've used is that my platform is multi-modality. There's all kinds of different modes, right? So, and I try to do kind of the same thing where there are a couple of videos that are on the longer side where it's like deep dives into a particular exercise or problem, but for the most part, the videos are like five, 10 minutes. And then there'll be like an interactive article and an exercise and a mini game. And it's, you're always bouncing between these different formats. And I think that really helps you stay engaged for a longer amount of time. Yeah. I've read that like learning styles is it's like one of those controversial kind of things that have talked about in instructional design circles, where it's more like teaching styles and you know, like we all kind of absorb information in certain ways, but you know, like it's really about this variety of. Teaching styles and delivery so that you're covering the gamut. And then somebody that has, you know, may learn one topic in one mode is might learn another topic in a different mode. And we're always kind of cycling just the brains back and forth. So like instructional design, matching that, and I don't think we see a lot of that. I see, you know, like you talked about the platforms that are kind of selling internet real estate, where you go in and you can slap your videos up there with some text underneath. It's all same. And it's just by the nature of the tools that we have at our disposal. Yeah. I mean, it's one of those things where if you're building a course platform that a gardener can use and someone who teaches cooking, right? Like there, in order to be broad enough to support every possible use case, you have to be really generic in the tools that it provides because you can't build specialized tools for every particular niche and topic. So that's one of the advantages of I can actually build the tool that I think would be most effective for teaching this particular thing without having to worry about whether I can kind of bend the platform to fit the shape that I want. Yeah. On a topic by topic basis too. So if like one topic deserves something else or needs something else, you can really dig in and that's very cool. Like that's, yeah. And that's actually something I've found that different modules in my course have a totally different distribution, like the Flexbox module, for whatever reason, I found most of the lessons in that topic have a video, or maybe that's not all video, but most lessons will have a video and for whatever reason, there's just a lot of things in Flexbox that really help to like show you visually and say, okay, well, here's this widget and here's why you do this. And this is what happens with this. And then often what I'll do is I'll put the, I'll build like a little interactive tool, I'll have a video that teaches something with this tool. And then the tool will be underneath. So you can kind of continue those explorations. Oh, so like, it's like watch and then play. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Was there anything surprisingly either technical or otherwise that the, about building your own platform that that's came up during the process? I mean, none of it was too unexpected. The only thing that really comes to mind is just that it took so much longer than I was expecting. I was thinking I would build the course and the platform in like three, four months, and I had the incredible luxury of doing this full time. So I had left my job. Granted, I was dealing with a disability at the time. So I wasn't like with my, I mentioned my arms. I wasn't working at full clip, but I was still working reasonably quick. And it took me about 13 or 14 months to develop the course and the platform. It was about half and half. I would say like half of that time, more upfront was on the platform. Cause I needed like user accounts and to figure out the stack and all of the different things that just go into any web application, and then of course, all the platform, all the con like the core specific stuff of the minigame component and all the little widgets and stuff, so it did, it took a lot longer than I kind of thought, right. Over a year full-time work, which is why, and you mentioned this earlier that like, whether or not most people should build their own course platform. I would have struggled to do this if I had other obligations. Like if I was trying to do this part-time on the side, I don't know that it's, unless you want to be really tightly scoped to a particular problem and like, you know, there's always ways to do stuff and it's just about figuring out the trade-offs, but I think it's probably a much more straightforward route to go the, using a prebuilt or other platform. If you don't have like a good amount of time to sink into it. Yeah. I think, well, I mean, you went for kind of a grand scale, I think also, right? Like you, you aren't teaching just a module, you are teaching people CSS as a complete picture. And I think that's a real, like both as a platform and the content challenges end up being rather significant when you, it just, you know, like you could scope that down and you could just teach somebody Flexbox for instance, in the terms of CSS, and that would be a much smaller scope project, but you were swinging for the fences, so to speak. That's a really good point that, yeah, there's 10 modules in the course. And I think most modules are long enough to be themselves a course. Yeah. I did the math a while ago. And like I said, there's 170 videos, 225,000 written words, 500 plus interactive widgets and exercises. Like it really turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected. Yeah. Grand scale for sure. Like that, and it's great because you know, like it's ambitious. And, and, but I think also, you know, like if somebody was sitting down to build their own thing, they could probably consider it at different levels. Right. Like, and I believe both strategies are great. And we've talked about it because, you know, like there's Kent's Epic React with grand scale, right? Like versus other courses, like an egghead course that we produce, which is, is not. Right. Like it's something that somebody can do and we can do over the course of weeks instead of months or years, which is, it's, it's always something to consider. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good point. So what's your process in terms of instructional design and when you sit down and you want to start working on a course and you're going to design a course from end to end outside of the platform, like what's your instructional design approach? Yeah. So I'm doing this right now. So it's the perfect time to talk about it. I start with a Markdown file that, and for the first, usually what happened is before I like formally start before I'm working on this as my main thing, I'm just like in my idle time having ideas, so I'll just jot down thoughts like, oh, this is something I want to make sure I cover, or this particular analogy is a really good way to explain this thing, or like here's an idea for a project. And over the course of maybe a few weeks, I'll gather a bunch of these notes and then it becomes time to like, okay, I want to actually start doing this. So I'll try to find organized piles of stuff, right? So figure out what the modules are going to be and what should be in each module, figure out what I want to cover in the course at all, or what I think is better left omitted, which is something I really need to work more on because I, my approach is generally that the scope just expands and expands and I'm trying to get better at like, no, actually we don't need to cover like every possible thing in the universe. And then once I have a solid enough skeleton where I have, let's say 10 modules, every module has like 15, 20 bullet points underneath it in terms of the different things I want to teach and some ideas around how, then I start with the actual content. So, and this too, I kind of take like, almost how I imagined you would carve something out of a block of stone where you start very coarse. It's like, okay, I don't need this huge chunk over here. And then you worry about the details later. So I'll just create a bunch of markdown files, just add like bullet points within them, those bullet points will become paragraphs. I'll have a lot of like to do comments, like to do interactive, whatever to do video that covers these five things. because what I've learned is if you spend time doing really refined versions of that now, you'll realize two weeks later, oh, actually this is totally the wrong way to cover this, or I don't need to cover this at all. And you've just wasted all that time. So I try to come up with like as broad as possible at first, and then slowly whittle that into something that looks more or less complete. In the past, I've done this module by module. So I'll finish all of module one, all the videos, all the interactives, and then I'll move on to module two. This time around, I'm thinking that maybe I shouldn't do that. Like maybe I should keep things a little bit coarse, because there is obviously relations between modules and you can still have the same thing where you're going through module two and you realize, oh, there's this really important thing that we need to know at this point. And it makes more sense to cover it in the past module. So I do think it's, I've had a lot of success, not going too detailed too soon. Right. So try to save a lot, especially like, it depends what's difficult for you. In my case, videos are really hard. Like it usually for a five minute video, it might take me two hours because I have to plan for it. I have to figure out what I'm going to do. It takes me five or six takes easily. That's pretty quick to be honest. Like video is way harder than I think people maybe give it credit for. It's challenging, right? Like, and the thing that's really challenging about it for me, at least, is after take two or three, I'll start to get frustrated and that frustration will show in the video and so I'll watch it the next day and I'll be like, well, I look miserable in this, so let me trash this and start again today. Yeah. There have been times where I've had to just ditch like many minutes, if not hours of video, because I just didn't like how unhappy I looked in them. I've cursed in many a microphone, so I understand. So that's the most, I try to save videos for the end. And I also, I'm trying to think now too, like if something is changing soon, like if I'm covering React and it's this like experimental suspense API, maybe don't use a video for that because if that changes next week, I don't want to have to rerecord it, right? Use articles that are easier to tweak and keep videos for the higher level ideas of, you know, just in talking about how React works, that's probably not going to change fundamentally. So that's a safer thing to do video with. But it also, I think, depends on the person, right? Maybe some people are just naturally charismatic on video, but struggle in terms of articles or these interactive things that might take them a long time to build. So I think it's about trying to optimize for your own personal, what you're good at, what takes you the longest. I've heard of people that will like dictate, you know, like do their writing through dictation, whether they're speaking and then refining it later, you know, so you would speak it. And to me, like what you've described sounds a lot also like if you're going to sit down and write a book, right? Like we're going to.\")\n",

And then, you know, we start at this low resolution picture and then we tighten it and we tighten it and we tighten it until you're down to the video, which as you said, to me, this is extremely smart. The videos are going to change where the text is easy to update. Video is very difficult to update. It's dense, it's hard to update. It's not super accessible because you then, you know, like transcripts and stuff make it more accessible, but you know, like it's a visual medium. So, you know, like that balance between text and video and thinking about those modalities is really interesting as well, I think. How has been like maintaining your course so far? I think you picked a pretty evergreen topic, right? Like I think there's a lot of CSS that's going to carry you for years, but what's the, like the maintenance process been like for you? Yeah, so there's been a lot and most of the maintenance is my own fault. Like it's not so much that the language changes, it's that someone will point out that I've made a mistake or there's some like, or if like five or six people have the exact same question, but they're like, hey, my code isn't working. Why isn't this code working? And they've all done it the same way. Then it's like, oh, well clearly I'm not explaining this very well because so many people. So that's what is, most of it's just been that is, okay, this thing, clearly there's a problem here in terms of the instructional design. So let me figure out how I can address this. And I've probably done like 15 to 20% of the course has been redone since launch with those types of things. Maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe 10%. Some like, it's not zero, but it's also not like huge. I do think that part of me, here's another thing that's frustrating too, is because I'm doing that module by module, I'm embarrassed by module ones and two and three. I've gotten so much better at making courses. So module 10 is like, in my mind, so much better. And the smallest number of people will see that, which is frustrating. Because it's at the very end and completion rates are what they are. So yeah, like, yeah. Yeah, so it is, but there's no other way to do it because I can't go in reverse order because I kind of need to know what's already been covered so that I can say, as we saw last module, like here's something I can take for granted. And then here's the new thing. I think it'd be a lot harder to go backwards. Do you think you'll spend time going back and actually redoing those, the modules that are frustrating for you, or you look at now and you're like, that is just not it anymore. Are you going to go back and actually refine those? Because you said you're working on a new course. I'm wondering where you balance like, well, I'm going to make a new course on a different topic, or I'm going to keep refining this course that I've already created. Cause it could be, you know, like I know in my heart, it could be better. How do you consider that? Yeah, so I really struggled with this and a big part of me did want to make version two of the CSS course right now. But it's true that most of the language hasn't changed very much yet, but it will. Container queries are right around the corner and there's all kinds of different additions to CSS that are going to really change how to solve certain problems. And you know, maybe it'll land in six months. I won't want to do it right when it's safe to use because I want to have my own time experimenting with it and figuring out the best ways to use it. So the kind of resolution that I've made with myself is there will be a version two of the course, probably in like a year or two. Like I'll wait until the content, not only for my own personal standards, because a lot of this too, is that you're your own harshest critic, right? Like I've gotten very few complaints about the quality. And so really it is just, I look at things and I think they could be better, but most people look at it and they think it's good enough. So I'm kind of using the fact that if I redid it now, I'd have to redo it again in a year anyway as justification for spending my time elsewhere. But it's a really good point that when I started on this journey, like I said, I thought it would take me three, four months to do a course. I thought I'd push out like two or three courses a year and I'd have like a whole catalog before too long. Now I'm thinking like in my lifetime, maybe I'll have four or five courses. And even that might be, because there is a maintenance cost and there is an ongoing need for these courses and the world changes. So like I've heard from some course creators that aren't in the tech space. There's a piano creator that created a piano course and he's had one course for seven years and the sales just keep getting larger and larger every year because he's making the course better and because piano continues to be a thing people wanna learn. So I do think that it's surprisingly viable to just pick one or two things and create those courses and then continue to improve them over the time rather than always jumping to the new. It's kind of a quality over quantity kind of question. And not that you can't make four or five high quality courses, but that idea that instead of trying to crank out several less ambitious courses every year, you're going to work on this and really consider it. I think that that's a great approach. One of the things I think people get hung up on and you seem to be pretty good at is this, you know, like the ideas for projects and interactive widgets and what's the secret sauce? Like how can we all be great at making awesome examples that people love to do? Yeah, that is a good question. And I don't have a great answer. Yeah, it's a complicated answer at the end of the day. I mean, I think that there's practical considerations, but ultimately it's really dependent on intuition. So it's a matter of like, I'm thinking, okay, I want to teach this thing. I'll give you an example. I'm building a React course. One of the early lessons in that course will be thinking in components, right? How do I take a design and figure out where to draw the boxes around what component should be where? And I thought, well, drawing boxes would be a great way to do that, right? Make a little thing where you literally draw boxes on the screen, and then I'll show you how my boxes look and you can compare the two. And that just, it's hard for me to describe like how to come up with those sorts of ideas. They kind of just happen. But I think they happen because I have this blog that also has these interactive things that I've done over a hundred blog posts now, I think. So a lot of it is just through like pure experimentation and practice over the course of years, but it is certainly a skill worth developing because, and that is like, and this is kind of a related question. How do you come up with like an example that is both simple enough to illustrate the concept that you're trying to teach, but not so unrealistic, like where the variables are called foo and bar, right? You want to have something that has real world that looks like the code you would write in your job. But the problem is that the code that you write in your job has all these different dependencies and edge cases and all of that complexity would be overwhelming. It is hard. Like it's not something I feel like I've mastered yet. It's something that I'm still kind of working on and trying to find the best example that covers the most amount of ground with the least amount of complexity. I think what's interesting is that you describe it as a skill and that's probably the best way to look at it. It's not like you were born with this ability to spin cool examples and, you know, like add fun, whimsical widgets to blog posts. It's something that you sat down, thought about, and have worked on for years to get better at and you still like aren't finished in that process at the end of the day. Yeah, exactly. And I think people that may be familiar with my blog, very few people are familiar with the fact that I had a medium blog before my custom blog. And I think I have like 50 or 60 medium posts and almost all of them are terrible. Like they are not worth looking at because they were my first blog posts, right? I don't have the natural gift that the first blog post I write is fantastic. I don't know that anybody does, right? Some people are better writers than others, I suppose. There's so many different little things that you have to be aware of in terms of pacing and trying to forget that you know things, right? Like the curse of knowledge is a real thing where it's really hard to put yourself in the position of someone who doesn't know this thing that you know and that's you're writing a blog post because you want to teach them something, but you have to know what it's like not to know the thing and it's really hard. So it does just take a lot of- It's just true across a lot of skills, right? Because the same is true for programming computers. Like how do you get good at programming computers? It's programming computers. That's always- And how do you get better at writing? It's like write, painting, paint. Like, you know, it's like these are difficult skills that you don't get to like have a magic bullet that embeds this skill into your hands and brain and arm movements and all that fun stuff. It's just work. And that's a tough pill to swallow sometime. I think it's good for folks that are willing to sit down and put in the work because it's definitely a competitive advantage. Yeah. So when people come to CSS for JS, what are they trying to achieve? What difference are they trying to make in their- Yeah. So, you know, actually it's interesting because I think if you had asked the average person who was familiar with my blog or my Twitter account what I was known for, they wouldn't tell you CSS. Like CSS was not kind of my thing, but what I- The thing that made me want to do CSS as a course was the realization that I knew so many people and I was in this bucket myself, who, you know, React developers, Angular developers, who were really confident with the JavaScript side and who had picked up HTML a long time ago, but who still struggled with CSS, right? People who just couldn't seem to get their intuition going and would always have these moments where they're going along, everything is great, and suddenly the box is in the wrong place or the flex thing is stretching too much or squishing too. And CSS is like a challenging language to really develop that intuition for, right? It's relatively easy to get started with, make the text red with color colon red, right? There's all these kind of immediate CSS properties that you learn, but then the problems of how do you build like a fully responsive, robust web application that does what you expect in this very implicit language. A lot of the CSS properties that we write have all kinds of like secret mechanisms that they fire off, right? There's things like containing blocks and stacking contexts and hypothetical sizes, concepts that you would not run into in your day-to-day life as a developer, but have this incredible impact. And I had kind of gotten through this transformation on my own where maybe like three, four years ago, I decided that I was really sick of having this experience of being knocked out of flow by some CSS. It's the same snippet I've used 10 other times and 10 other times it worked and now it's doing something different and I have no idea why, there's no error message, there's no console log, right? It's just not doing what I... And my solution for that was to really try to understand CSS at a deeper language. So I would go and read the MDN article for the properties that I'm using and follow the links to the specification and try to understand. And this was like a very time intensive process over the course of years, but it really helped me develop confidence with it. And because I was already reasonably confident with JavaScript and HTML, it felt like the final puzzle piece that was snapping in. And honestly, like I don't wanna oversell it because it's true, like I still run into all kinds of problems, right? I don't mean to say that CSS is now like everything always works the first time, but I'm so much more equipped to deal with the cases where it doesn't do what I expect, right? I have enough of a mental model in place that it usually doesn't take me that long to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. And that's made a tremendous impact on just my overall happiness as a developer. And the fact that CSS just doesn't change all that often. Those were kind of the considerations of like, why did I wanna do this course? And so in terms of a very long winded roundabout answer to your question about what people can expect to get out of it, hopefully the goal is to give you that same sort of confidence with the language where you're still gonna struggle with CSS every now and then, or you're still gonna run into problems where it doesn't do what you expect, but you'll have this kind of underlying tool set, this mental model of how the language actually works that you'll be able to solve those problems. You'll have like a procedures you can follow to figure out what's wrong and how to fix it. You'll understand how the different layout modes work and how they're interacting to hopefully change like your overall experience as a web developer, because as much as we try to avoid it with different tools and different abstractions, CSS is always gonna be something that we need to write in one way or another, right? It's the only visual language the browser understands. And so it is really important to get comfortable with it. And that's kind of the goal of my course is to give you that comfort with it. And it's not that you're not gonna have to visit MDN. It's just, here's a shortcut to give you the literacy you need to like jump ahead and solve a lot of those problems and have that kind of, I don't know, reduce a lot of the cognitive load, I suspect, at the end of the day. Yeah. And just the problems that you can solve now that you could not solve before. I think that's exactly right, right? The goal, my, and this is maybe a little bit less ambitious, but still quite ambitious goal is that when you hit that moment of like, you write the code, you run it in the browser and it's not doing what you expect, instead of just being stuck and like, well, I guess I'll just throw random properties until I get what I want. It'll be like, okay, let me think this through. I know that move. So I think we all do. Yeah. It's more, so now the idea is it's like, okay, so I have these properties, right? This is how this layout mode works. These are kind of the constraints are on it. Oh, right, it's not working because I forgot to select my minimum width on this thing to zero. And so the Flexbox algorithm isn't letting it shrink below a certain point, right? That's kind of the hope that I have is you're still gonna run into these quirks, but you'll have kind of the tools needed to deal with them. So one of the things that I've noticed, generally speaking, when people talk about courses is marketing and this idea of marketing a course and like marketing is the most important thing. I was wondering if you think that's true and if like, how do you market your course? How do you think about marketing when you approach your course and the platform? Yeah, I mean, I do think it is really important that you can build the best course in the world. And if only like five developers know about it, it's gonna be really hard. Like, you know, I imagine there is always word of mouth. So maybe it will kind of slowly grow out of a small group, but really it's a tremendous advantage to be able to have people that are already following your work. And this was kind of the reason I felt confident going in this direction, right? Because I did, I left my job and I spent a year working on a course. It was about, actually, it was six or seven months between when I started working on it and when I had my early access launch. But still, that's a lot of time to commit on something that you don't know will work. And the reason I was relatively confident with that was that I already had a blog. The blog had reasonable traffic. I think it was maybe like 50, 60,000 visits a month. And I had like a Twitter presence and I was starting to build my newsletter, my email. And it's just kind of a numbers game, right? It's a matter of if I build this course and if the course is good, I will be able to reach out to, you know, 10, 20,000 people immediately and let them know, here's the thing that I'm doing. Some percentage of them will be interested in it. And that's kind of how you build that initial group that can then become the people that advocate for it and evangelize it for you, right? If your course is good, it will develop those sorts of relationships and it'll, that's the model that I had seen work for other people and that I imagined would work for myself and happily, happy to report, it seems to have worked pretty well. What channel do you think was the most effective for you? Where you have Twitter and your blog and your email list, what worked the best? So email definitely worked better than Twitter. I don't, you know, I didn't take super close care to collect the right analytics, but what I could see from the referrals is that people that had come straight from Twitter, they made up both a smaller amount of traffic and a lower conversion than people that came from email. But email was only possible because of the blog. So I think like ultimately the reason the course worked was the blog, right? The blog is what gave people both the exposure to me as a person and my work, but also the confidence that like, oh, this blog post taught me something. I bet if I buy the course, it will also teach me something, right? There wasn't really gamble of like, well, he seems like a nice person and all, but I don't know, like, will I actually learn anything? You can actually point to like, and actually what I did is maybe for five or six lessons, I just took the lessons out of the platform and put them into blog posts. They're not exactly the same because like I had to remove the videos and the exercises, but in terms of the interactive widgets and the articles, that's all the same stuff. And then at the end of those blog posts, I'm able to write like, hey, this was actually a lesson in this course. If you liked this lesson, you can go here to learn more about the course. And I think that's probably still the main, that and the email list are how people continue to discover. It's kind of a system that you described then because Twitter is part of that too, because you're announcing people and they don't have to trust you to, you know, like read your blog posts, but to buy your course, they would need to trust you more. So they end up at the course and don't convert. But if where the articles end up, you know, getting them on your list or giving you more of a sense of trust, I think that kind of cycle makes a lot of sense. I think especially like maybe, I mean, I only have myself, you would actually be a better person to answer this question than me, but my course is priced relatively high, right? It's certainly like in a different- I so disagree with that statement. Well, compared to say like the $10 courses on Udemy, right? There's kind of different categories of course. I think you're probably like a third of what you could potentially charge for it. I wouldn't say should, cause it's your course, but that's where I'm at. But anyway, I digress, go ahead. Yeah, you know, it's a matter of for someone to come and if they don't already know my work, why are they gonna give me hundreds of dollars, right? Like it's a pretty big ask in the best of cases. And I think the reason people are able to make that, to leap to that decision that it's gonna be valuable for them is that they've seen firsthand what I can do to help them learn. You've built authority and trust and you know, like you're giving them value so to speak for free anyway, and proving to them that they can take a risk with, you know, like a bigger leap. Yeah, and that's kind of my assumptions that the bigger the price, the bigger the leap, right? So the more you have to kind of have already shown them. I think if I didn't have a blog, but I did have an audience, it might make more sense for me to create a lower cost course because then people wouldn't have as much reticence or you know, nervousness about it because it's 20 bucks, it's 100 bucks, right? It might be an easier decision to make than oh, it's three, $400. I would challenge you to raise your prices and just see what happens. Just saying. I've raised them a couple times. It's relatively small and it's true. Like, you know, I already get a lot of people emailing me and they say that it's just not within their price range and I do feel a little bit, you know, it is. Well, I mean, they make books and there's all sorts of stuff that people can go do that might be more in their relative price range. And that's something I've started doing that I feel good about is I created a list of my favorite free resources because there's a bunch. And so now whenever someone asks about the price or like wants a discount, my response is always, well, look, there's many ways to learn CSS, right? I learned CSS without my course and here are the resources that I use that are free. Yeah, that's wonderful actually. That's a fantastic idea and a great solution to that too because it's true and you're being helpful. And then in the future, if their situation changes, then they're gonna think about, you know, Josh Gamo, the helpful CSS person that gave me this list of resources and now I'm ready to go big. Yeah, hopefully. Actually on that, maybe a year ago, I wrote a short ebook, Building an Effective Developer Portfolio. That's great, I've read it. I appreciate that. This was also, there was, you know, at that point I hadn't really decided I was building a course, but it was something that I had seen in my future. And the thinking here was, let me build this thing, it's gonna be free. And I'm gonna be marketing it to people that are just at the start of their careers. So I had this kind of idea that people are gonna download the book, it's gonna help them get their first job. And then when I create a CSS course, a couple of years later, they're gonna now have these, you know, higher paid jobs and they'll feel like, hey, this person helped me once, I bet they'll help me again. It hasn't converted as well as I, in fact, it's my lowest converting of my three lists, right, I had that list, I had my general blog updates list, people specifically who wanted updates about the course, right, that one was the highest because people wanted information about the course. But for people who were only subscribed to the portfolio book one, it was like a quarter or a fifth of the conversion of people that were only subscribed to my blog one and maybe others. So I was surprised by that. And I got the most complaints too, because I sent like five or six emails during the launch window. Please stop emailing me about your CSS course type of complaints, yeah. And like, whenever I would get one of those, I would check like, which list is this person subscribed to? And even though the portfolio list was maybe like 20% of my list, they were like 60 or 70% of the complaints. So I don't know why that is. I guess maybe it's that a bunch of people just saw a freebie online. It wasn't super applicable to them, but it was free. So they joined the list and they completely forgot about it. And now here's some random person sending them all this email. There's like a deep strategy there. Cause you know, like people talk about keeping your list warm and you know, like bridging people from one interest. I mean, you can like really get into like a deep rabbit hole. I always recommend Brennan Dunn's work in terms of if you really wanna go deep on that sort of segmentation and personalization, nerdery, it does go deep. And I also don't generally go that deep. I like knowing about it, but it's like, you can really get complex with it and strategic, I guess. Easier to just throw the noodle on the wall and see if it sticks. Yeah, I mean, I've done a little bit of experimenting with paid ads and it became very clear to me very quickly that this was a viable route, but it would require way more time than I wanna put into it right now. So it's about balancing. And I guess a solution to this could be hiring people or finding agencies that do this kind of thing. I'm kind of, if I make, maybe the biggest mistake that I make in terms of like just overall profitability is that I try to do everything myself. And part of that is just like, I don't really care if it's less, like I just enjoy doing it that way. I like the control that I have. And I like that like no one else is depending on me. Like I can just do whatever I want whenever I want without worrying about anything. Like that's, I really enjoy that freedom. And if I was working with someone that required me to set up certain analytics and that's overhead that I'm currently not optimizing for. But yeah. And it's also like, what's good enough for you too, right? If you needed that and you were optimizing for maximum revenue, that's one story. But if you're like, I want work-life balance, I want enough for what I need. And I wanna create something quality that I enjoy and I don't enjoy managing people or whatever that means. And that's a, I think that's a way to look at it. And like in terms of your own personal mental health and just general health, it's just a great healthy way to look at it, I think. Yeah, I agree. What's your most audacious goal with your course platform? If you were really thinking about it and you were like, where do I wanna be? What's an audacious goal that you've set for yourself? You know, it's interesting. I don't really have any audacious goals. You know, my goal is always just to make a living creating courses that help developers learn things. I suppose that, you know, my goal is for that to grow and for me to have kind of a wider and wider reach. But I don't really- That's more reasonable than audacious maybe too, I guess. Yeah, like, you know, I think a lot of people that do the kind of indie hacker thing have plans of raising money and hiring employees and becoming this world-changing company. And I have zero interest in that. In fact, like a bunch of people have mentioned to me now that the course platform, I should like build that as a SaaS and white label it and sell it to organizations. And that probably would be a great business, but I have no interest in it. So I guess like the most audacious thing about my goal is just that I want it to be, I want it to be growing every year until I reach a pretty substantial size of the market. But it's not really that, I wouldn't call that audacious. I think it's just- I think that's a reasonable and healthy look at it. I'd agree, it's not necessarily audacious outside of, you know, just the fact that you're running counter to what maybe is hustle culture or whatever you call it, where people want to do a startup or build a SaaS or, you know, be a billion dollar unicorn versus just, you know, helping a good set of people and make a comfortable living and not be stressed out all the time. Like that's nice to you, right? I mean, I think that they're both like, you know, if that's, if someone really wants to go that route then there's nothing wrong with that. It's just not a route that appeals to me. Yeah, I think that, yeah, for sure. And I'm pretty much there with you though. I've brought in more collaborators over the years and have learned to balance that. But at the same time, it's like, there's a level of enough and just kind of getting in there and doing good work and helping folks is pretty fulfilling in and of itself. Yeah, I mean, I should also say too, like I've been doing this for less than a year. So maybe like, as this becomes more normal to me, my kind of appetite will increase. But for now it's just, I want to do what I'm doing. Yeah, Josh, I really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you for creating CSS for JS. I think it's an awesome resource and you really hit a sweet spot. And, you know, this idea that developers can not be so scared, cascading style sheets is a true thing. And I think it's going to be successful for years to come. I look forward to seeing what you do next and thanks for chatting with me today. Well, I appreciate it. Thanks for having me on. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey, Scott. Hey, how's it going? I'm doing great. I'm looking forward to chatting. I really love what you built with your level up tutorial site. And I think you, you've added a really interesting piece to the conversation in our web development sphere with your podcast that you record with West boss. Before we get started though, I was curious when you sit down to learn something new and you're learning a new complex skill, what's your approach? How do you go about learning something new and difficult and challenging? Yeah. Part of my approach typically is just to get my hands dirty a lot. I'm definitely more of like a learned by doer type of person. You know, it's never really the type of person who was fully calculated before starting anything. It was more or less, you know, Hey, this thing kind of looks neat. Let me see if I could get just anything kind of working on it. Whether that isn't in code, right? If it's in, if it's in code, I'm going to maybe read the read me, but do a little bit of hacking on it first to get it something up and running, get it kind of working and then just experiment with it. And it's just in general life skills though. I'm definitely trier, you know, I'll try a whole lot of things and whether or not they're successful or not the first time doesn't necessarily mean that I have to stop trying, I guess. Are you a consumer of courses? Yeah. Yeah. I do watch a lot in mostly just because I'm not a skilled reader. I have dyslexia. I have a really bad short-term memory. I have a lot of challenges with reading. So it's like, I ended up missing a lot of things. It's really weird for me. I'll, I could read a line in a book and then have to come back. And when you go to the next line, I'll like read the same line again and not realize it. It's just challenges the way that my brain functions. So I ended up consuming a lot of audio material, a lot of video material, just in general, I retain it a lot better. When you're doing that research, what are you doing to like capture it? Because I have the same struggle. I'll go through something and it just like, it kind of disappears off into the ether. But how do you capture it? What are your kind of, I guess they call it personal knowledge management strategies these days. I use Obsidian for a lot of things to just have the whole linked notes system. But primarily what I'm doing, like while I'm learning is I have the Remarkable tablet, have you heard of this? Oh yeah, it looks like paper has a pencil look to it, right? Yeah. And it's an e-ink tablet that like the battery lasts for like two weeks. So it's always. Kindle drawing tablet is how I think of it. Exactly. Yeah. And because it's like always charged whenever you need it, I always just have it right by my desk. So I'm usually just kind of sketching out things on this all the time. Just writing quick little notes to myself, especially if it's small topics, if it's large topic, I'm, it depends on like what my learning is for. If it's learning to reproduce it into like a course setup, I'm usually firing up like a, like an outline that I have for putting together courses. And then I'm starting to take notes and do a little bit more of like a structured outline for the course, rather than like for my own brain, I suppose. But usually I'm just like kind of sketching out things. Are you a visual note taker? Like little doodles and stuff to go along with your notes. Yeah, but they're not like good doodles or doodles. They're just like, yeah, yeah, definitely. That's not a requirement. Like I personally, when I'm taking notes like that and I love, like that's why I love paper and lately good notes five on the iPad has been really great for me cause it's just super simple, but it's always like little scribbles and lines and, you know, like connecting and just a way to like process it in my brain and give that visual connection really has helped me quite a bit in terms of memory. Yeah, totally. I do like drawing emphasis on things and yeah, absolutely. What are some qualities of a good course in your mind? I think for me, it's more or less like what the user takes away out of it. And like, sometimes, you know, there, you get into this flow of like the course has to fit a project structure and it's nice to like walk away with a project, but oftentimes, you know, that can come at like a detriment to the course where you're just like kind of shoehorning things in there to. Finish or complete the project. So for me, it's like, is the user going to have enough of the core experiences that they would have when they're working day to day and like be able to potentially understand when bumps come up, what they can do to solve those bumps. It's like, it's kind of tough because you're often, you don't want to overexpose somebody to the, like the amount of things that could go wrong. You don't want to try to cover all of the bases. You're like preparing for something that's not going to happen there, right? Oh, if you do this, it could break this way. If you do this, it could break this way. The user largely doesn't care about that when they're learning something, but like being cognizant of maybe what the most important things are to either call them out or even show them is in my mind, like, you know, a big problem with courses because they do, they talk about like course fatigue where people that buy a ton of courses and don't take them or they take them and they can't get out of that flow of, okay, I did the course. Now what? Now what? Yeah. And so that's always been like a thought process in my mind is like, will the user be able to actually do the common things that you would need to like make an HTTP request, display some data, put this up on the internet somewhere. Like the common patterns that you're just always going to need to have in just about every single project, make sure that stuff's covered in a way that they're going to be comfortable doing that on their own without you. I don't think anybody wakes up on the weekend is like, I'm going to take some courses this weekend. Generally speaking, they're wanting to make some sort of difference in their lives and what, like in your experience with level up and otherwise, what is the difference that like a developer is trying to achieve in their lives when they're seeking out a course? Yeah. You know, I deal a lot in like, kind of like newer technology stuff or maybe like even just released kind of things. And oftentimes they're looking for, how do I do this thing? I already know how to do in something else again, because it's, yeah, I do a lot of beginner tutorials too, but like the most of what I'm doing is for that intermediate person who has like, at least an idea of how things generally work, or at least they have a, you know, just a prior experience there. So it's more or less like, what can we do to like, reassociate these topics with things that already exist in your brain? Most likely. How do you like keep abreast? Like, what do you know in terms of what to teach, right? Like you, you're trying to keep current and there's always this change. And particularly in technology, right? There's always something new and interesting. How do you sift through all that and decide what it is you're going to like spend your time as a teacher producing to help people get what they want out of tech? Largely, it's largely what I'm interested in. And, you know, I do listen to what our subscribers are trying to work on or what they're interested in or what technologies they feel are underrepresentative, underrepresented in content. But I, for the most part, like if I'm not excited about something, it's really hard for me to teach it. Like I'm excited about it. And if I'm not excited about it, it's really hard for me to like find those nuanced things that you would find. Because I'm going to be like just putting together code examples for, you know, for the purpose of doing a course and not for fun and to learn this thing. So, yeah, I have a little bit of a struggle with that because like I do often struggle between like, is this the course I want to do for me or the course that's going to be most useful? My wife always says I'm like three or four months too early on a course. She'll be like, you release this course four months too early. Like nobody knows what this thing is. And then like four months later, someone else will release a course at just the right time or who knows what, you know, it's like for me, it's definitely a little bit of a struggle, but definitely something that like I pick stuff that I'm interested in. I'm like recording a course right now on Svelte Cubed and like doing 3D in Svelte. And it's largely just because, well, besides the fact that, you know, we're going to have, we're all going to have to learn 3D at some point if we're doing UIs for augmented reality and who knows what in the future. But it's nice to have a little bit of an exploration there. And when I was just diving into Svelte Cubed, I had done React 3 Fiber before and I was just thinking this stuff's so cool. I mean, this is so exciting and it's really easy for me to crank out too many demos for a course because I'm really just like a kid at a playground, right? I'm just making stuff for fun, making stuff for myself, really. How do you figure out like what the examples or what the demo is going to be when you're, when you are playing around, when you're in exploration mode and you're trying to figure it out and narrow the field down to what's going to actually make the course? How do you, what's the process for coming up with good examples? Yeah, I oftentimes I'll have a bit of an outline of like the core concepts that need to be taught in something, right? Where it's like, all right, you obviously need to know updating state. You need to know this, you need to know that routing, whatever. You have these core ideas and I'll outline those. But when I'm coming up with like the project examples, they're usually, they're usually I'll come up with an example and say, Hey, I need something to show a spring, like a spring animation using 3D. Okay. Well, I have the ability to create something kind of fun here, or we made something kind of fun in this last video. Why not just make this thing bounce around for a little bit and then I'll fork it. I'll change it. I'll tweak it. And sometimes that turns into something like totally new. Sometimes it stays the same as just like an augmented version upon the last one. You can think about like remixing a song or something like that. I'll occasionally I'll come up with something and then I'll fork it. And by the time I'm done with the fork, it will be something completely different or it'll be a slightly different version of the thing that we had. And I'll usually do all of those. Code examples and everything while I'm working on the outline. So everything has its kind of a perfect flow, you know, like right now we did the 3D course, so, or I'm working on it and it's like the first 10 videos show you what you need to know to understand, like just the basic syntax of working in 3D with something like Svelte Cube. Then we do a project, then we get into some more interesting stuff. Then we do like a project that is using some more of that interesting stuff. And then we're kind of like drip feeding the skills and we're not showing you all of the API at once. So that way you can actually make interesting things or things that will like at least give you those bits of excitement from working on something. I don't know me personally, like when I'm really excited about a topic, which I'm sure it's pretty common when I'm really excited about a topic, I want to consume a lot of material. I want to work really hard. I want to like experiment with it and just try all sorts of new things. But when I'm just doing it for, you know, business or whatever, it's a slog and it's a grind and I'd rather not be doing it. When you're just trying to get work done versus like exploring and playing. Totally. Yeah. I'm very much a motivation. I mean, like that type of motivation for me is really big. Cause I've always been the type of person who does like to experiment a lot with things. You know, my background before web was in motion graphics and after effects stuff, and you can just tinker with that stuff all day long. And so like, I've always been a bit of a, just a tinkerer in that regard. Formal approaches to instructional design or other ways to think about the instructional design aspect of creating courses, not necessarily, you know, I think there's a lot of learning that I've had to have done, like we all end up having to learn a lot, I think in our lives. Yeah. Yeah. You know what, a lot of it kind of has either been like nothing formal, so no formal anything, but maybe through the school of YouTube comments and people being rude to you online, so like I've had enough of this sucks for these reasons. Or you did like, for instance, you told me at the title of this video is going to be installing WordPress plugin. Then you didn't do that for two whole minutes. I was just thinking like, Oh yeah, you're right. Okay. So there's no general like actual validated learning structure for me, but I've been recording for so long that I feel like I've gotten enough comments from people that they've either told me what they liked or disliked or whatever it's been honed down over the years. I was wondering if learner feedback affected the design of your courses and besides the comment section, are you using the, I mean, you said this already that you're mostly exploring your personal interests, but like how does that feedback loop come into play? And do you do any sort of like testing with users before you release a course? We don't do a lot of testing with users specifically, but we do have a discord channel that's like always active and I'm in there 24 seven because it's how my team communicates, but also like, yeah, how everyone in our community talks about things and I get it kind of a good idea for our community in general and our users there based on what they're talking about. But we also do have like the ability to vote on course topics that at least gives me some feedback in terms of like what they're interested in. And we have the user submission things, which people do use. We, I mean, we get a lot of people asking for various topics. I think one of the challenges with, especially with video driven courses is maintaining the course over time. And like you said, this stuff is always changing. What sort of effort do you put into maintaining courses or is that, you know, something, is it always sort by new is the best approach? Yeah, we've kind of had, um, I don't know. I have a bit of like, just anxiety around that, that topic in general. I released like a massive, I released a massive react native courses. Like one of my first premium courses when I was trying to migrate off of YouTube. And it was like, I put so much time and so much effort into it. And not only like, was it out of date, like the next week, cause it was react native, but like it didn't do great in sales because of, you know, now I have to rerecord this whole module like a month after I released it. And it's just so much like, I can't believe I wasted so much time doing that. And then I've put out other courses on CSS and CSS variables and, you know, browser APIs that are never going to change and they're like evergreen. So it's been a bit of a learning experience for me. I've, I try to, I try to like really minimize usage of extraneous libraries wherever possible, because one small API change can just goof up your whole course for, you know, forever. So I try to stick pretty close to the Dom APIs, but a lot of the stuff we're dealing with nowadays are frameworks and they're this or that they're getting changed versions, completely just dismantling your entire course. And what I end up doing more often than not is like doing a completely new version of the course a year later or two years later, three years later, instead of. Trying to patch it or keep it up to date. It's just like, all right, this one is now out of date. Let's scrap it. Let's put out a new one. Kind of deprecation, right? Where you put a version number on the old one and put the new one out and tell people that the new one exists. Totally. Yeah. And we're often trying to keep things a little bit more scoped to version numbers. Like people often ask about release dates, which we have added. I was resistant to adding release dates for a while because I didn't want people to think like, all right, this course that came out two years ago, which is still super relevant. I don't want people to feel like that content is too old just because we're on the web and everything is a hyperspeed. I would rather like that release date be the versions that the application's tied to. And I suppose that's something we should probably do. We just haven't done, but yeah, it's a constant challenge for me and one that like I do occasionally lose total sight of that and I'm like, I'm just going to pick this thing because I'm really super interested in it. And then half a year later, I'm like, man, I should have picked something a little bit more grounded in the APIs rather than something that's brand new. Do you think, is it, do you have any flagship courses or ones that are like a particular draw that they get people in to your kind of ecosystem or how do you look at that? Yeah. And I think there's some of my favorite courses that I've like done. We have a design systems course with CSS and it's all about how to use CSS variables and you know, like classless CSS to build out your foundational CSS before like really going ham or using frameworks or this or that. And then we have like a modern CSS layouts course, which is like, how do you use CSS grid and Flexbox to build several different layouts? Like we build TweetDeck and we build like more interesting layouts like TweetDeck, but also like very generic layouts that you'd typically see. And those courses have been really rock solid for me for a long time. And I think a part of it too, is that like, that's some of my favorite stuff. I always feel really like, man, I should just do another course on interesting CSS stuff because it's the stuff that I'm most interested in personally, and it's the stuff that doesn't go out of date the fastest. So like, maybe I should just nail that down a little bit more, but then, you know, then there's things like Svelte Cubed calling my name and now I have to do a 3D course on Svelte. Do you ever consider breaking off? I know, you know, you have level up, but breaking off and doing like a standalone CSS jam, for instance, to where you take that and kind of take that love and develop it into its own thing, is that something you ever consider or are you pretty focused on, on kind of keeping it under one roof? I'm pretty focused, but mostly just because of time, you know, we have a two-year-old and a four-year-old and I would just like, I don't get like a full eight hour workday based on when they come home from daycare, my wife works full-time and like, it's just a struggle to get all of my stuff done. And even before this year, really, I was doing 12, 24 video courses a year. So. Cause you were trying to hit one a month, I think was, if I remember right, that was your goal, right? So I've been doing one a month since like 2017 on LevelUp. And now we have a guest author, every other author. So my, my 12 has gone down to six courses and that has been like a tremendous life improvement for me in general. Yeah. I mean, when the pandemic first hit, you know, we had two kids at home, two young kids at home and my office and my wife, and I'm trying to record, she's trying to get work done. We got two kids running around. Yeah, I had to do 12 courses that year and it was impossible. So like ever since then, I've just been like totally burnt out on it. And I've been doing my six courses a year and feeling really happy about that. Yeah. I noticed it. And I noticed the recent addition to the platform is that you are now including guest instructors. How has that changed? Like at the business level or kind of process level, adding folks in to, to create courses with you. It was always really scary for me. I'm not a great communicator in terms of like organizing things or planner. I maybe I'm not a great planner. Yeah. I'm not a good manager. I've never really had that role. And so for me, it was always really tough to coordinate things. I would have interest to people wanting to do courses, wanting to be involved in the platform. And I would just be like, okay, cool. Yeah. We'll get you in and then just not have the bandwidth to take care of it. So part of the biggest thing was we hired on, we hired on a guy who was a node developer for us. He did like amazing work, but he also just happened to be an exquisite planner. And so he started, he basically set up the whole flow for how we connect with content creators and how we get involved. And ever since then, it's been way easier. I'm coordinating with people and I'm lining things up and I'm feeling really good about it. But even just to get that process in place, to get started, wasn't super easy for me. But I, you know, people are out there making really amazing courses. And like, there's so many people who are exquisite at teaching. So it's really nice to be able to have people on the platform. And, you know, part of like our whole goal with doing this is, is trying to like enrich everyone's lives, you know, who's involved in it. Right. And I used to work at a record label, Ghostly International, and they had this like absurd royalty rate for their like their sales. Like basically every other record label is giving you like a one one or like one to 10 percent on sales or something. And they were giving like 60 percent. And like, I just remember the artist being like, wow, this is so cool. This is like how they should do it. And I've always like really wanted to, if I was going to bring other people in to have it be in that sort of capacity where we could pay people based on streams. So they get paid like a percentage of the total revenue for that month based on their stream numbers, as well as for sales. So like if they're bringing people to watch their course and people are watching the course, then they're going to get paid directly. And again, this was like all stuff that this developer, his name's Tom Allen. He's really talented. He he really helped us with and helped us get going with. And yeah, just a big upgrade for all of our lives over here. I'd love to if you're willing to kind of describe the flow and the process, the time Tom had has brought in to level up. I'd love to hear more about that. Yeah, I think it's just more of an organization. You know, we had GitHub issues and things like that where people could leave issues and connect and whatever. But no, he basically just went ham on Google Forms, made a bunch of Google Forms. And that was really it. Let's have a submission form. Let's have a content creators form. You can vet them these ways. We have all this information. And I think he had worked at Pluralsight before. So he had a little bit of he had a little bit of experience in this world of online education and how working with content creators. So he had definitely like a just that that right amount of experience and knowing, you know, how a lot of these flows can work. So that's really it was more or less like instead of just emailing people here and there, we're going to have a process. The process is they submit the form. We vet the form next. We do a one hour long interview. Then we connect with them. We depends on their experience, how much we have to monitor what they're doing or not doing. And mostly we're working with content creators who have been, you know, fairly active either on YouTube or anything like that. Or we often have to see quite a bit of work from them before signing them up for good, getting people going. But since we're not trying to do it too much, right, we're doing one every other month, it's been pretty nice to coordinate everything to the point where now I don't have to worry about what the heck I'm doing for next month's course, I can worry about the month after and put more time into that and, you know, feel less less burdened by the stress of having to come up with a new topic every single month. Speaking of burdens and stresses, you've created your own. And I'm wondering why. Why not just use something off the shelf? You know, go rent real estate from Teachable or Podia or whatever. Why not? Why not just go that route instead of building your own playground? Yeah, a lot of it is because, you know, I get to get really deep into stuff with my own platform, right? Like building, building the whole UI in SvelteKit recently was a way for me to say, oh, I actually have found the pitfalls here. I've understood, like, what are the common things you're going to hit when building a major app? And I think that's like really helped me. And I'm the type of person who does churn their code base too much, right? But in the same regard, like rewriting my components from React functions to React hooks was a big way for me to really, truly understand them. And so it does act as like a sandbox. But then again, it's, you know, it's a full on platform that we've been building for since 2014. I think we started initially on Meteor and it's been shifted here and there. And now we're on SvelteKit in a Node API with Mercurius. But I didn't actually pick anything off the shelf because really at the time there wasn't a ton of options. We had a Drupal site that did a lot of the stuff for us. But I wasn't a skilled PHP developer, and I probably could have hacked it together. But I was just feeling like it'd be really nice if I had full control over this thing. And even at the time when I first built it, I had two separate sites. I had the streaming service, which was just the streaming service. And then I had an e-commerce store that was for T-shirts and mugs and what, which I also wrote just for who knows, because I wanted to torture myself. I wrote an e-commerce platform, right? And then I ended up merging those two sites into one. And then I got to use an e-commerce code to then sell the digital goods and the tutorials. And yeah, at the end of the day, there was not a ton of great options at the time. I think if I was doing it again today, I might even use something like Ghost and because that's up my alley, using something like Ghost. They actually the initial version of the site was written in Reactive Commerce or Reaction Commerce. Reactive. I never touched that. I don't know what that is. So it was initially also a Meteor based platform that they moved and then it was since been sold to MailChimp. And it was a really good platform. But again, to get it to do exactly what I wanted it to do, I would have had to do so much work to it. And at that point, I was like, well, I might as well, if I'm having to design these systems or work within someone else's design, I might as well design them myself from scratch. And sometimes that like that mentality for me is something that other people need to say, don't do it. Yeah, I wish in my life that more people would have said don't do that because I still suffer today from like my week two decisions in 2014 when I sat down to write this platform. My friend Jared Palmer says you should just do this in WordPress. And that I was like, I was like that left me shook. And I was like, what do you mean? He's like, look, they got the plug ins. They have all this stuff. You're literally just producing a blog. You could just use WordPress. And I'm like, that doesn't sound like any fun. I know. Yeah, I know. It's it was a huge problem. And I was like, yeah, but I want to be able to do this and that. I want to be able to have it do this. Like I too much of that. It has to be exactly the way that I I envision it or see it or whatever. And yeah. What are the essential features of your course platform for you? Like what are you know, not just a general course platform, but for you, what are the essential features for me? I really wanted people to be able to like purchase things as well as do a subscription. And actually, for I think before we had the subscription at all, it was you'd purchase them in one off, one off. And it was mostly because we didn't have the library to support it.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So it was like, well, who's going to subscribe if there's like two courses here. So we built up the library and then did the subscriptions. But for me, I really wanted to have that connection where somebody could subscribe, get access to everything, or buy the same thing on an individual basis and have the same experience with that course and just have those features be like nice and easy baked in all LinkedIn together. And another thing is I really like writing admin tools and dashboards and things like that. So like having my own platform, it was really easy for me to get the data I need, get the tools I need, build it in a way that is like our video uploader. Right. We use mux for our video platform. Our video uploader is like really great because I got to work with YouTube's video uploader for so long. I know which things I like and don't like about it. And now I can have my own video uploader drag and drop the file in automatically does this and that and pumps this thing up to, to mux. But like for me, I just, I've really just straight up enjoy writing that stuff. And then maybe that's part of the problem is that I'm just at first and foremost, I'm a, you know, developer by all of the, by all of the markers. I just really want to make things. I just find that joy in it. Well, it's the part of your job that brings you joy. And I think that's a really good feature for a course platform versus something off the shelf where you just use it, like you're just consuming it, which is enough for a lot of people. And I think that's fine too, but you know, like as, as somebody that can make it, you do, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, right. So that's interesting to me that you talk about the subscription versus the single purchases. And I'm wondering if you don't mind sharing, like, what is like in terms of revenue drivers at this point for the platform, what, which do you see like pushing it, the single purchases or subscriptions? Definitely the subscriptions and the single purchase is like a very small part of our revenue, but we do offer it because I know I've had people express to me that like their companies won't allow them to get a subscription or a reoccurring bill or whatever. So that's largely why we did it was so that anyone who wants to learn like one particular topic out of this bunch could just say, all right, I've been given, you know, this amount of money from work so I can just buy this one singular thing and so it's largely available for those people and at this point, like it makes up a small percentage, but like the features there. So it's not like we, you know, it's not like we, we're not going to use it. So I would say it's maybe about like 10% of our revenue, which yeah, not bad. Non-trivial, but it's not the main revenue driver. Yeah. And largely we haven't focused on it too much in terms of like, we're not like the most metricable, like we're not like devouring analytics to get people to buy things a la carte either. So it's, you know, it exists as it is. So one of the things that I learned pretty early in, in selling products online in this space over the last few years was that people want you to have purchase power parody like West boss does. And I was wondering, is that something you've been able to implement or do like, it was like, I couldn't every, we just got a lot of ton of emails and it was always referencing West and I think it's amazing and it kind of forced us to do it. And is that something you've explored as well? Yeah. It's like been perpetually on our list forever. And the, like, honestly, the only reason it hasn't been done is because like for sales, it wouldn't be too difficult for individual sales, but I don't know what do you use for subscriptions for your merchant, but we use Braintree and like Braintree's API is such a nightmare sometimes that I just, I would honestly stay awake thinking about how am I going to implement P in Braintree and have it work in a way that I'm like happy with. It's, it's just like, it's always a kind of one of those things that like, it's very frustrating for me to work in that API. So we implemented it in Ruby. That's how we ended up doing it and did a custom implementation and we use Stripe and thank you for like affirming my decision to use Stripe because their API is actually wonderful. It was, it's challenging though. And we've done it, we've done a couple implement implementations and I think there's services now that'll do some of it, but they're, you know, they don't fit into everything. It's a hard problem, but it's like one that's interesting and kind of good to solve I think at the end of the day. I agree. And it's something that like I really want to do, but man, yeah. Like I said, those Braintree APIs, I said something, I said something about Braintree on Syntex a couple of weeks ago and I had some people from PayPal reach out to me asking me about my experience. I was just like, Oh no, I don't. Yeah. I honestly, I do, I do probably wish I would have used Stripe overall just because I had more experience with their APIs even back then when I started it. And it wasn't all the time, but I just got so many requests for PayPal. I didn't want to maintain two separate subscriptions and went Braintree. And yeah, yeah. That makes sense. And I took the opposite cause I just don't support PayPal. And you know, like, you know, like you're, it's kind of six and one half a dozen, it's trade-offs right? At the end of the day, when you're designing a system like this, you're having to make trade-offs. Was there anything that has surprised you either technically or otherwise while you've been building a course platform over these years? Yeah. You know what? It's, it surprises me just how like how little some users will look for things before like sending an email, right? Yeah. Like that gets me all the time. Like I'll get an email that just be like, can you cancel my subscription? And it's like not even with the same email address that they signed up for with the site, but even like, would you email Netflix and just say, please cancel my Netflix subscription? Yes. People do constantly all day long. It's my, my, my guess. I don't know. I don't work at Netflix. I would imagine they do as well, but like, it's so wild how many emails I get from people that either just like they didn't try or whatever, or people say, I can't believe that you charged me a second time. The support, like the, just the people, the questions and support is maybe what you're saying to them. Like, I agree with that. Oh yeah. It's been mind boggling to me. Do you get any, have you, have you hired help for that or do you handle in all the support yourself these days? How does that work for you? 50 50. Yeah. It depends on the problem. Some things we do require a little bit more hands on for me, but yeah, that's actually been what part of like what we've been working on with making, I guess, the platform better by like hiring people, right. Whether that is marketing people or developers or anyone trying to expand just a little bit. Like I don't, I don't want a huge company here, but I do need help to the point where I'm not answering all of the customer support, doing all of the video editing, doing all it's like, it's, it was too much for me to do all of it. Yeah. And you said earlier that you kind of weigh, you know, you're not a manager. And at the same time you need to have that, you know, like you need help to kind of do what you want to do and live your life. So how have you been dealing with that? Cause that's trade-offs too, I would think. Yeah, it's been challenging for me, but I've gotten a lot better at it. You know, a couple of years ago, I probably would have been a lot worse about it, but we have a handful of people who work on the site here and there for us, we have a full-time marketing person who started in November. We like, we want to keep it small. We want to keep it tight knit here, but the same regard, like just trying to develop the systems, prepare for people to be able to access things without me. Right. Like every single customer support request should be able to be accomplished, finished via the UI of the site that like somebody could do if they had the knowledge of using Facebook. Right. We want to make all these things like really easy for anyone that brings on. And then that brings us more development. So then I'm heads down trying to develop these things or hire someone to do the development on these things to have the features just to support a customer service person to take things off my plate. So it's like to get things off my plate, I have to first add 10 or 12 more things onto my plate first. And we did a whole big list of all of the things that I'm doing in the business and how we can reduce them or fix them or make them a little bit more processized, a little bit more streamlined or have the right people take it, take control of them. And it's been endlessly amazing for me because now again, I'm getting to focus more time on doing courses. I'm getting to do like focus more time on even doing YouTube content, which is something that I stopped doing. Kind of going back to the root. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have a YouTube channel that has 340,000 subscribers on it. And it's like, I'm not using a lot, utilizing that at all for anything. So now it's like, okay, well, I have some free time because we have third party content creators. I'm not doing the marketing. I'm not doing all of the customer support. I'm not doing the editing anymore. So I can use that time to crank out three YouTube videos a week. And that's actually really easy for me, you know, the video part, like sitting down and recording technical videos is something you got absolutely down. I would suspect at this point. Yeah. I would have to imagine I've done like 3000 plus video tutorials, which yeah, just a wild amount of time. I have no idea how that happened. So you've recorded this long-term podcast with West Boston. I mentioned it earlier, but like Syntax FM and you know, it is extremely popular, people love it. How does that relate to your business that you're running? You know, like, does it affect that? Does doing that work? Does that effort over time, do you see like kind of return on investment in your time invested there? Yeah, totally. And you know what I, one of the best parts about doing the podcast with West is that we have like such shared interests, right. That like, there's really nothing better than like popping on a zoom call and just chatting with him about something that, yeah, it is. It's like seriously just catching up. And most of the time, like sometimes. Like one of us will have the lead on an episode or an idea. Like Wes is more experienced in this, so he'll take the lead or I'm more experienced in this. And it's almost like, you know, you're doing a teaching each other back and forth kind of thing. And honestly, it's been awesome for me to get the level up tutorials name out there a little bit more. What's funny is that just because I never put my name out there that much for like the first two years of the podcast, people were like, oh, it's the level up tutorials guy. I had no idea, like people didn't know my name because I, you know, I have a Polish last name and whatever, but people didn't know me by my name. So they only knew me as the YouTube guy. And so that was like a really nice thing to be able to maybe attach some of the work I had already done to the work I was doing like presently. And honestly it does, it opens me up to like learning a lot of really like newer things. It opens me up to like being maybe a little bit more on some of the later stuff that I could then take in to do courses. But it also gives me, you know, we hear from our audience a lot, so it gives me years into what people are interested in or what people are wanting to do. Do you have any sort of audacious goals for your course platform? Are you thinking, is there anything where you're thinking really big and what you might do over the next years or what have you? I don't, I don't know. Nothing like huge. No, my, my goals are, I would say they're pretty measured. I have like maybe large goals in terms of like, I would like to get more people helping here and there. Right. But like those aren't crazy goals and I wouldn't necessarily say any of my goals are audacious to the point where, I don't know, they're that big. It's mostly, they're mostly smart. Like what, where's this going to be in two years? Where's this going to be in five years? Would I like to be doing 12 videos, 12 courses a year in two years? No. Okay. Let's, let's take a look at that one and maybe let's work towards it. So I've always been definitely like a smart goals kind of person in terms of like, I used to do monthly resolves, you know, like everyone does yearly resolutions. So I do monthly resolutions, these big life goals that these are the things I would like to make some progress towards this month. And I'm fairly good at chipping away at something for a long period of time until you're good at it. You know, you had mentioned before the dance stuff that I do. Like I started dancing when I was 18, like long after, like you're supposed to, like you're supposed to start when you're like 10 so that you can get really good by the time you're 18. So I started when I was 18 and people thought it was really weird that I was like learning at that age and whatever. And you know, now I've been all over the U S entering competitions and doing all that stuff for so long. I just showed up to practice three days a week. I just showed up and then, you know, 10, 10, 12 years later, I can do just about anything I wanted to do in the dance space. And that was the same way with YouTube. I just showed up three days a week to record and same with the podcast. I mean, we've been doing the podcast and we haven't missed a single episode. The first one we've done two episodes a week. We've we show up every single Monday unless there's something really bad. Actually, I've missed one episode. Wes has made every episode. I missed one episode because of the birth of my second child. He has a decent excuse. Yeah. But even then, like, you know, all of that stuff, just if I can get it on my schedule and on my calendar, that I'm like really good at showing up and doing it and then making that little chunk of progress each day, showing up and sticking to it and doing the work is such a, it's such a good skill and habit to be in and you reap the rewards, right? If you don't do that, it never happens. You won't make progress. You won't get good, but like practice and, you know, keep doing it and kind of get through the, get through those initial kind of suffering points and you'll, you can really do a lot of stuff in this life, I think. Yeah. It's pretty amazing. Cause like when I started recording video tutorials in 2012, I like had no, no intention of making a career out of it or even eventually, you know, starting a business, doing video streaming or tutorials. I was just a developer and I was doing those videos essentially for fun or to like maybe make some rent money for you from YouTube, but you know, just several years go by of doing it and all of a sudden it's like, oh yeah, it turns out you've gained a skill from doing that. That's awesome, Scott. I really appreciate it. And I appreciate the work that you do. And thanks for taking the time. Well, thanks. Thanks. Hey, I appreciate, especially when we had our group in the past, but you guys like just tore, tore me apart on some of the things I was doing on my site. So I definitely appreciate all of the help you've given to me over the years too. Cheers. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm, I'm so stoked to chat because one, I'm a, I'm a big fan. Your work is something that, that we dug into and it's helped us in my business and getting like a better understanding of visual design and your course is excellent and kind of was a Eureka moment for us in terms of using Notion as a platform for delivering courses. And before we get into that, I have this little icebreaker where I'm just curious. How do you, when you sit down and you're about to learn something new, something complex, whether it's technical or otherwise, what is your approach to learning a new complex subject? Oh, that's a great question. I'm typically kind of full immersion. Watch all the YouTube videos, read everything I can. I guess it really depends on what it is. If it's something highly specialized and I realize, okay, this is way, way too complex for me, I'm going to have to have someone else do this for me. But either, even if it comes to that, I still think it's helpful to gain as much knowledge as you possibly can, just even to ask questions to the expert that you may bring in or learn enough to do it on your own. I think that's interesting. And I don't think anybody else has answered this question, hire somebody. And that makes me really curious. What does that look like? You'll get in and you're like, I need a specialist to come in and either do this for you or teach you, or how does that work when you get to that point? I'm, I'm kind of actually thinking in the world of like home renovation stuff right now, and so like, for example, we have a lot of concrete we needed to get poured and we were like looking for a very specific texture. So I'm like, I'm watching videos. I'm messaging people on Instagram who have done like a concrete work that looks amazing. I'm like, what finish are you using? And so I'm like transferring that information to the person that we eventually hired, but on the tech side, like I can write some JavaScript and I can do a few things with code, but if it gets too complex or if there's databases involved or really any backend work, that's just, I know that I don't have the efficiency or the time to invest, to go down that path myself. So I will end up just either hiring someone, just literally reaching out to someone that I know has done that type of work before, or kind of reach out to my network to see if I can find something. It's funny for me. Cause when you talk about home improvement and DIY and that sort of thing, and I'm always like, sure I can hang drywall, but I can't do it very well because I don't do it every day. And there's like a certain point where you're like, well, I could just hire an expert and get this done. I don't want to be an expert in this subject. I need to just get an expert to handle this and that's it. Or hire an expert to learn from too, which is always an option as well. Yeah. And I think that's, it's more of a, I don't know, five year question, 10 year question, like, do I want to be good at this? And do I want to rely on myself for this? Or do I know, is it just a one-time thing? Does it need to be good enough for now, or I'm not going to start a drywall career anytime soon. So if I have to repair, you're not looking to have a concrete business. If I have to repair a wall that my son drove his skateboard into or whatever, you know, I can do that. Well, and in that case, I'm like, well, you're going to have to get on the YouTube and learn how to texture the wall and decorate it yourself. Cause you know, and then it's a question of how long do I want that hole to be there? There you go. And how bad do you want it to look afterwards? So speaking of like hiring experts and to me, in some ways, if you buy a book or take a course, you are starting a relationship with an expert and learning from them up to and including like direct, direct mentorship, right? Do you take courses? Are you a course taker? I have taken the occasional course related to like business or I've taken some Ramit Sethi courses. Those are always good. And yeah, I really kind of, I haven't taken a ton of courses, but I think usually for me, it's like trying to find that a lot of times a course is like. Wrapped around like a couple of key principles. And if you can, sometimes you need even a book, you read a 300 page book and then you can break it down into like these three main things that they kept telling stories about and hammering in the points and so, and if someone were to just read three bullet points to you, it wouldn't stick as much. Yeah. Just flip by. Yeah. And so, so I think it's kind of like, for me, it's like trying to figure out like, what are, what are those two sentences that I paid a couple thousand dollars for to like really make it stick and be meaningful because that was kind of in the realm of things I was trying. I know like patterns and design is important to you. And I mean, design in the broad sense, not in the kind of the visual sense. And I'm wondering like what goes into a really good course from a design perspective that would help make it sticky and make it something that would last and be useful for you long-term. You mean from like creating a design course? No, just when you, if you've taken a course and what, basically what makes a good course from your perspective as a learner? Yeah. I think the best courses would have a very strong point of view in terms of like who it's trying to teach and what level they're at first of all, like solid baseline, but this course is for X person. You can add any number of variables to make it, but then also like you have your starting point and then I think the best course would know exactly what the finishing point is as well. So you're taking someone from A to B and you're getting them there as fast as possible without sacrificing inequality. And then once, once they're at the B or finish line location, what evidence shows that they now are indeed there. I think some, some courses are going to give you the, like kind of points you in that direction and maybe it's, I'm not going to take a master class on throwing a curve ball and then all of a sudden join the MLB in six months because it took this course. I'm gonna have an idea of how to get there. So I think there, and there's also some like expectations to set as well, but I think that's how I viewed a really good course. Just like starting point, ending point, and being able to, to at least speak to or prove, show evidence that you've achieved that. Yeah, that kind of, but transfer skills where you can apply it to new situations and that you truly understand it because now you can take that and use it in your day to day. Right. How do you describe shift nudge, which is your course and it's focused on kind of web development and visual design and mobile development. How do you describe that to folks when they are making everything that goes into the visual side of design, like all of the tiny details to make beautiful interfaces, so everything from typography, color layout, all of those, like really nerdy, tiny details that go into just making something look beautiful as it relates to interface design and product design. So for the longest time I was, I had written an entire curriculum or at least the outline for both a kind of like a product slash user experience design course and a visual design course. Cause I was like, oh, this is what I do. I don't really, I'm never necessarily only focused on the visuals. I'm always keeping in mind, like how that relates to the product information density. You know what, and there's always a part of both sides of your brain that's thinking about the experience and how it looks, so I was thinking, well, I'll just, I'll just make a course how I would normally approach a product. And then as I talked to more people and I consulted with other people, as I was trying to put everything together, this one lady told me, she was like, there might be people who already know a lot about user experience and they just want to know, you know, all of the visual things and you can, it's a lot easier to drill down on a specific subject than it is to teach a really broad. And I was like, and I'd already invested so much time in putting together the outline and I'd written half the curriculum and then I ended up like cutting it in half and then redoing the entire outline based on some of that feedback, that that's a really long example, explanation of what my course is about, but that's kind of how it came to be at least then. So now it's easier to explain because it's, it really is. Those really nerdy details about what makes great design for interfaces. And I, there is like a user experience lens and you will gain some insight into my design process, but it's all about the visual side. And that's kind of how I explain it now, because that's the process that led me to create it that way. One of the things that struck me, like as a learner, taking your course was when you get into it and the initial sections felt like a really good introduction to design in the broad sense, right? Like if you design as something that, that like there's visual and user experience and instructional design and design is just a part of our life with intention, if you will. But you had a really good kind of worldview that you exposed to folks front, which was really appreciated. Awesome. Yeah, I spent, I mean, looking back at like the outline and the curriculum and the lessons, it really, it almost seems simple. Like, oh yeah, of course you'll have a starting module. And then of course these would be the initial lessons, but I, it took me so long, when you think of just blank canvas, it was like, I must've spent six months or more on just the outline and trying to piece it and cause I really wanted it to be really valuable, really impactful, and I was like, there's no way I can just jump right into to font size without some type of like meaningful. Here's how I think about design. Here's my mindset for design, for learning, choosing software. Here's my design process, some overarching things. And I think that also makes a good course as well. I think you almost need to, I, at least with the bigger topics that you're trying to, maybe you're a lot of people are trying to switch careers and interface designer or UI, so I think that requires a lot more than, okay, here's how the rectangle tool works in Figma. And here's, we're going to jump straight into making frames and all this stuff. You kind of need a little bit of like a introduction and maybe not so much for here's how a course about animating objects with JavaScript, you might not need a big introduction other than maybe like, here's why you might do these things. So I think it, it also just kind of made me feel good, you know, in a selfish way. It's like, all right, I'm going to, I'm going to, a lot of people have this, like, I don't know why in the UX world, maybe even in the just designers in general, you could even broaden that to just people in general are extremely opinionated, especially with their process, JavaScript framework or not, or Figma or sketch, or should you wireframe or not? And yeah, so I just kind of want to lay it out all on the table. Like, this is what I think about these things, and this is what you need to keep in mind while I'm teaching this content, because if you disagree from the very beginning, maybe you might need to just get a refund, look elsewhere, because this is kind of like my approach. And if we're not like hitting it off and nodding our heads together in agreement at the very beginning, then it might not work out. I say you hadn't me nodding my head vigorously in the first parts of it. And I think what's interesting is what you talk about. And it's like a practitioner that's been doing this for a long time, has built up a system and worldview over time. And I talked to my friend, Marie Powell, and who helps people build notion workspaces as an educator. And at first it was like, here's the full, the kitchen sink and people would just get kind of sad and confused and you can't even start and then has switched sense to like, let's build a system together because you were going to have your own system to understand this. You can't just drop into my system. You need to develop your own, but here's the kind of the initial building blocks to start climbing the ladder. Yeah, absolutely. You mentioned talking to people and I thought that was interesting. And I was curious about your research process specifically for shift nudge, but I would assume it's kind of similar for other projects as well. What's your research approach when you start thinking about a new product or course? Yeah. I don't know why every time if I've ever done a, like a work, a design workshop at a conference or even just shift nudge students, even asking like user research, I think there's like a, maybe there's a stigma around quote unquote, user research would be this like extremely formal process. And, oh, I read this agile framework for systematically interviewing users. And it sounds like almost like, am I doing this wrong? Like it, I don't know. It just, I, so I like to just think of research as just simply asking questions, um, and just reaching out to people, asking them questions or being that information and then making decisions based on those answers. And that's as simple as I, I mean, that's, I guess, as complex as I like to get with, I like to just ask people questions and listen to their answers. And maybe they're a little more open-ended. Maybe they're a little more leading depending on what I'm trying to figure out, but I, I first, I think the very first question that I asked about this particular course was sending an email, like research survey to my email list. And it was less about like, what do you want out of a visual design course, but more, it was like, Hey, here's four course ideas that I'm thinking of. That would be, I know that I could teach these things. Which one are you gravitating more towards? And I think it was along the lines of like product design, like systematic processes, all things related to like creating a product from beginning to end, specifically like for freelance work, contract work, things like that. And then the second one was interface design, all the bits and pieces of learning how to make beautiful interface, which those two are definitely like really related, but I think you could, you can definitely break them apart. The other one was like designers learning CSS. I was thinking about teaching like a CSS course or something just specifically from a designer's perspective, like forget about all the complex stuff. Like how can we wrangle some CSS to make things look good in a browser? And then the last one was like a, some, at the time I had like an introduction to icon design course that I had just released is actually still active. Intro to icons.com. I was thinking about creating maybe like a premium version of that one, because that one's free. And then based on the, I guess the results from the survey, it was pretty, the majority was like obvious. Everybody on my email list at least wanted an interface design course and followed like by a close second product design, so I just decided to go with that one because Hey, I'm going to, I want it to be successful for both the people that are already kind of like waiting on something and also just from a, it's interesting trying to balance like student success and business success. Those aren't necessarily always easy to align. So I wanted to make sure that was as aligned as possible from the very beginning, because it's really tough to change from doing consulting work and design for client and then be able to like focus fully on like a really huge robust curriculum course, like shift nudge. So it was kind of daunting. I'm like this, if I screw this up, I'm gonna, I'm gonna like. That's material effects on you and your family basically. Yeah, exactly. You aren't new to developing products. You have a kind of a suite of products that you've released over the years. And I'm wondering, is creating a course different or do you approach it differently or is it similar in terms of just kind of, of fundamentally the approach and the research process? I think it, you could simplify it and say that it's similar with, I will say that the other products that I've released are extremely simple compared to a course, like the little contrast color picker thing is extremely simple. A little app, the flow kit stuff that I've done is pretty simple. You're drawing arrows, one, you're checking colors, one, you're drawing. There's not a lot of complexity to it at the high level, but with the course, I think the hardest thing, the most complex thing that I encountered when developing a course is just, I like to think of myself as a pretty decent. Here I can explain things. I'm, I like to step-by-step explain things to peers and clients and day-to-day work with clients. Even I feel like a lot of it is teaching someone why we should go with this instead of that. So it was kind of a natural progression for me, but I found that one of the most difficult things was just trying to get out of my own head in terms of this should be for everyone or no, this should be just for this person or, oh, this lesson's stupid. This is, this sucks. Nobody's going to care about this. So I think, I don't know, maybe because it's more like you're putting more of your own knowledge on the table. I know it's, it's not necessarily all about a knowledge transfer. I think it's more about taking someone from point A to point B, whether that's with your own knowledge or with your own resource curating or the other thing, but I think it's like a more of a, I don't know, it's like a, it produces a lot of anxiety and while you're trying to do it, you're like, oh my gosh, like I'm going to talk myself out of this. Whereas a product, I think you're, maybe you're detached a little bit more personally. Yeah. It's more like a tool versus, I don't know, like you're trying to help a person achieve an objective either way. Like they use your tool to do this, but there is a lot more depth, I think, to the, to shift nudge over, over a plugin for Figma, for example, like that does a specific thing and it either does it or doesn't do it versus shift nudge, where it's a huge gradient of potential outcomes that people are seeking and it needs to kind of line up with all of those and effectively help them get from point A to point B and achieve whatever it is in their life, which certainly isn't like nobody wakes up and thinks I'm going to do, I'm going to take a course today. That's what I'm going to do. That's not what they're trying to do is take courses. They're actually trying to achieve something. So it's like this kind of a struggle to get them there again. Exactly. Yeah. I always love the drill and the hole analogy, or it's like, I'm going to wake up and use a drill today. And people are like, Oh, and actually you don't even want a hole. You just want the cord to go through the hole to power your laptop or, you know, what, that you can abstract it out like 10 different times. I don't know if we're ready to get into a jobs to be done discussion. Yeah, probably not. So, and just kind of related and it is related to that and other things. Do you have a, like, like a framework for instructional design or is that something you studied or how do you approach instructional design in general? Yeah, I don't have a great, let me look into my filing cabinet really quickly and pull out my 10 steps to instructional design, I think for me, I, I almost approached, I can draw some similarities between even user experience design and teaching someone how to use typography for interface design, I think, cause that in a way you're leading, you're trying to determine where someone is and where they're trying to go. And I'm just, I'm trying to apply that, I guess, to each lesson and each one, like one, I don't know, like one module, for example, is trying to take you from beginning to end. And then each lesson is like this little mini journey from A to B as well. I actually even consulted with this professor, a buddy of mine hooked me up with this professor of, I don't know if it was continuing education, some professor of education at Clemson university. And he was like in charge of the global education. So anyway, a lot of my curriculum and I had like a couple of hour long conversations with him. And he explained a lot of like his philosophy behind just education in general and the process. And I found it to be almost like as much of a therapy session for myself, as opposed, in addition to like instructional design learning, because it was like, okay, I'm not like, I'm not the grand knowledge holder that is bestowing upon. I'm so blessed and I'm bestowing all this knowledge on all these people. It's like, no, I'm just, I'm facilitating someone from not knowing to knowing. And whether that's through my own experience, some exercises or Hey, here's 10 articles that you can read. I think that made me feel a little bit better about the instructional design process, where it's like facilitating you to get from point A to point B versus bestowing my grand knowledge on you. It's funny. You said, I don't have a, I can't reach into my file cabinet and get a book called the 10 steps. Um, my favorite instructional design framework right now is literally called temps, 10 steps to complex learning. I think I saw you tweet that. And I think I bookmarked it and I was like, oh my gosh, I remember reading through like the overview and I was like, okay, this checks out. This sounds like a plea. What I did, even if it was like a happy accident. Yeah. I mean, I love, like, I love a good framework, like regardless. I always, I really love to get it. I honestly do too. And I think I could probably benefit from having a few more dual frameworks that I'm like legitimately trying to follow. Yeah. This one, and I've studied a few and this one just was like, Oh, this is it. And to me, and you mentioned this and I truly think there's a lot to this is user experience design is instructional design, and I think people sleep on instructional design and all of the research, cause there's a ton of research in that area and you could apply this to like product development in a very real way and it would benefit everybody involved. Exactly. I feel like even this is maybe farfetched, but like, even if you're like trying to give someone directions somewhere, like some people are extremely bad at giving directions and it's, I almost like, cause in order to give really good directions to drive somewhere or to where I'm at in the stadium or wherever, whatever you're trying to do to give directions, like you almost have to imagine that close your eyes and imagine where that person is, where they're driving, where they're walking, okay, you're going to see this sign. When you see that, take a look. I feel like it's the exact same thing when you're designing an experience for a product that you're setting up a course and trying to guide someone through that whole process. And I think it, it does go back to like communication and instructional design. Even though the root of graphic design is called or considered communication design and you're trying to communicate things visually. So I, yeah, I think there's, there's a lot of frameworks and things that are maybe overlooked or it's like, Oh, this has actually existed for decades and no one's really regarded it because it doesn't have a cool, trendy title on it. Yeah. People like to rename and reinvent. That's something that I've noticed in technology in particular. And it's always a cycle of like, well, we're going to come up with new names for these patterns that have existed for 75 years, because that's how we build our own name, is by renaming something that already exists. Yep. Totally. So I'm curious, and you've mentioned this idea of getting people from point A to point B and like understanding what their success is and what point B is for the learner, and I'm curious, how do you know when a learner has achieved what their, they've set out to do with shift nudge, what's the kind of indicator for success that you look for? Oh, that's tricky because I mean, I'm ultimately looking for great design, handling typography really well, color, all those things together, layout, nice spacing, negative space, all the things that, and it's weird, it's, I found it extremely difficult to take, uh, some, I mean, there are definitely some objective principles when it comes to design, but some of those can be like, if you know them really well, you can actually break them and make something a little more interesting. Yeah. And so that makes it really difficult to like objectively say, this is exactly what I'm looking for, because if someone's really talented or really skillful, they could check seven things off the list, but break three intentionally because of a certain reason. And then it's like, wow, this is even better than I thought it would be. So it's almost, it's tough to like, have a specific rubric for someone to go through and say like, yes, this satisfies all. It's one of those things where it's like, you listen to music, listening to music is probably another good example. It's like, is this song good or is it bad? And it depends on who you ask. You could objectively say like, okay, yeah, well the chord progression is in the key of E. So that's a check mark. Algorithmically or whatever, right? Like, like this is algorithmically good versus something that, that has soul. And, and so like, I think music is probably a really good example because some people love a certain song, some people hate a certain song, but whether or not someone likes it or not, it could algorithmically ask all of those, those check marks. So it's like, I mean, it's kind of a smoke and mirrors when you're trying to determine whether or not something is good. And as it relates to design, I am objectively trying to check these things off in my list, but also like trying to, I'll never get away from my personal opinion about whether or not I think something is, is good or not. Even if I've seen things that are, that look amazing, but it's like, it actually looks like you might have kind of ripped off this other brand a little bit. And it, I was going to say like one of the drawbacks to this algorithmic approach where this is objectively good, according to the algorithm is now every single startups and landing page looks the exact same and flows the exact same way and uses the same like illustration style and same color palettes and you get the same, which you see in music too, right? Like, okay, this is what a hit looks like. So keep making, and like you remove that aspect, that advancement, like a challenging design or a challenging song. And you listen to it the first time and you're like, Ooh, no, no thanks. But you listen to it the fifth time and you're like, okay, okay. And you start to feel it. And then like, how do you achieve that? Or even impart that onto others would be a, that's a lifelong challenge probably. Totally. And I think it, I think, yeah, I think that's really where the music, I don't know, analogy comes to life because you can almost track any decade of music. And there's usually like a pivotal moment where I'm, when you said, when you were talking about songs, I was immediately thinking of like the hair band.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"power ballads of the eighties. And it's like, this is how this is a band in the eighties. Then all of a sudden Nirvana comes along and they're like way different, grungy. And then all of a sudden alternative music is born and now everyone's doing that. I think maybe they were all checking their own algorithmic boxes. Yeah, I think there is a certain amount of personal taste. I think we look for even in design, I think being able to express personality of either yourself or a brand or a product in a genuine way, I think that is what makes, you know, great design. In addition to all of the fundamentals, if you're able to project that in a way that represents personality in a way, because I think you wouldn't necessarily say, this is the ideal type of human being. They are this gender, this height, this, because I think it's extremely problematic, extremely. And I think the same thing would apply to maybe design, maybe music. I think you're not ever, you'll never make something that applies and works for everyone. And I think, yeah, it's that interesting of objective and subjective kind of coming together the same way that two people might not get along that well, but then they both have their own best friends that they hit it off with really easily. Have you seen any sort of like outside of their designs look good? Have you had any inspiring success stories come out of students that have taken shift nudge? Oh, yeah, definitely. I've had, so when I first started, I started reaching out to a bunch of the beta students for like, Hey, what are you, I basically started kind of trying to like inquire if anyone had anything decent to say about the course. And a lot of people were just posting stuff in Slack, like, Oh, I love this thing and this thing. But I had one guy in particular was reaching out to me and he was like, Hey, I've always been a UI designer. But now that I'm adding UI and visual design to my arsenal, I'm up for like a. I think he said he was up for like a salary increase of $20,000 because now he could effectively do this. And then he, he was able to use that in another interview and he was able to, I think he told me he ended up making like $50,000 more at another job than, than he was previously. And he attributed it to his new like UI skills because previously he was. Like user research wireframe only kind of, that's always the one that stood out to me just because it had a, it's easy to like put a $10 amount. So I was like, Hey, that's quite the return on the investment, but I've got like, I have this, the page on my website. If you go to shift nudge.com slash reviews, it's maybe a little outdated, but I, anytime I got a testimonial, I would put it on here and, and it was just like, it became almost like fuel for me to finish the full course. Cause I was like, okay, whenever I think this sucks, I can come back and read what I copied and pasted from one of my Slack messages and I'm like, okay, this is not the worst thing I've ever done in my life. I'm actually, because I guess it's easy to like, look at a polished landing page and think, Oh, they really have it together. Matt's doing amazing, but you're still human. You still have self-doubt and you're, you need some like encouragement. So yeah, that's where I kind of keep my library of when you need a little boost time. Just to get you over the finish line and be like, this is good. People like it. It's fine. Keep going. So you mentioned beta students and I think that's really interesting. And I was wondering, how did you test this course and how do the feedback from actual students maybe change your design or alter what you had originally assumed about the course? Yeah. So I think I decided pretty early on that I wanted to do like kind of a limited quantity beta student group. And I also decided early on that I wanted them to be paying customers as beta students because I had, I created a, I did create another course back in like 2015 or so, and I had a beta group, but it was like, anyone could join if they wanted to. I did just, Hey, you can sign up for this week and you can join. I think it, it felt like it kind of fizzled out. And I knew that if I had paying customers, they would give me real feedback because they put their money and invested it. So I decided to do kind of a simple landing page. I charged for it and I only let, I think I said I was going to do like, I was going to like open it up for a couple of weeks and either the time was going to close and then I would just begin the beta then, or I would close it if up to a hundred people joined. And so I actually, the very first time I did it, I had a hundred people joined before the enrollment even ended. So I just shut it down. And then I was like, Oh my gosh, like it's okay. This might be a viable business. Number two, people are interested and also they're excited about joining that. So we all get in a Slack group together and I committed to, to basically reviewing every single student's work myself and giving either written or video feedback on everyone's work. And I didn't realize how much of a, how time intense that would become. Quite the chore. And if you've dug around in the course, you can see the critique vault is kind of like a never ending sea of loom videos of like reviewing pre students work. And so the way I had it, I basically come up with a fairly tight curriculum based on my press, like reaching out to people, asking people things. I would send people my outline and kind of try to get feedback. And then I had a, I would say I had about third of the course recorded and then maybe only a half of that actually edited and ready to view. And so, and that was actually one of the reasons why I started using notion because I was like, how am I going to, I don't want to transfer all of this undone material to some teaching platform when it's not quite even ready and I'm not ready to like invest in this new platform and commit to something else because notion was working really well as just a way to organize my thoughts and to create pages and sub pages really quickly. So I was like, I'm just going to add all of these beta students as guests to the notion workspace. I can like change things really quickly. They can leave comments. If something's confusing, they can like write them. They can either message me in Slack or make a comment in notion and I can either answer their question or I can like change the content on the fly to make it more applicable to clarify any points that might've been confusing in the video and so during that beta period, people were going through, I would let them know like, Hey, module four is now available. I got all the videos done and people would, they would go in and they would make comments on certain things and say, Hey, what did you mean right here when you said system fonts? Can you explain that a little bit more? And I'm like, oh, okay. I need to actually go a little bit more into detail because like you're, there's always the idea that you're cursed with knowledge, so you kind of forget that there might be some things that people don't know, the beginning of, yeah. It's like, what are system fonts? I don't know. I didn't know that San Francisco was only available on the, on iOS or Mac and not on Microsoft, whatever. So like little things like that, I would, I was able to go in and update the content and if maybe I missed most of the pages, the lessons, they have a big video, 15 to 20 minutes, and then most of them also have like all the written content that I gathered in preparation for that lesson as well, so I didn't bother going in and like changing a bunch of the videos, I would just go in and add supplemental material in the written section and that way I was able to, even if someone asked me a question later, I could at least link them to that section and I even ended up making another couple of lessons based on, you know, I kept getting questions about like layout issue or even as I was reviewing student work on the layout module, I was like, man, I'm finding myself explaining this concept over and over in a lot of the reviews and I, I didn't have a lesson on it, so I created a brand new lesson called layout connectors and I just, a little bit of a rougher, like loom video as like in response to everyone's work that I was reviewing and then I would, so I'm kind of think of the material as like a little bit of a living, breathing document that I can keep updating or I might find an interesting or tweet thread and it really relates to color or type fonts or whatever and then paste it in there, that way it's just kind of constantly being updated and somewhat more relevant than it would be otherwise. Has that feedback loop slowed down over time? Yeah, it definitely, it has slowed down and I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's because the content has become more polished or if the, maybe the, when I had the a hundred beta students, it was like very personal, it was like we were all in one big group and I would chat with them every day and now when the new enrollments come in, it's a, there's like a little bit more of a disconnect between the students and myself just simply because I do not have the physical bandwidth and the time to invest in the new students as I did when it was a much smaller group. You're bringing in design advisors now, so you're bringing in third parties to kind of handle some of that. And I was curious, has that, how's that worked out and how did, you know, like, how did you start to think about bringing other people into your house? Yeah, so I, like I said, with the students that signed up for the beta group, I was doing it all myself and then I actually was planning to release the public course in like March of 2020. But I think anyone who lived through March of 2020 knows that was a little bit of a hectic time. And I was like, there is no way I could possibly promote and an online course online during a protest, coronavirus, presidential stuff, and so I decided to do a second beta group and I was basically committed to another hundred students to my surprise. And then, so I had a, for almost all of 2020, I was doing nothing but trying to finish the course and also student reviews and I was just completely swamped. I knew my like public launch was coming up soon and I didn't promote that I was going to give feedback on everyone's work, but one of the mistakes I made when I recorded the course, I think I was in the mindset that it was like, Hey, I'm here, post a video in Slack, post your work in Slack. I'd love to check it out. I'd love to review it. And that's just not the case. Like I cannot, I don't have the time to review everyone's work that's getting posted and I almost went back and like re-edited the end of every video. That was one of the mistakes I made was like trying to let people know that, Hey, I'm going to be checking out your work every time you post. It worked up front, but then like when I had my first public enrollment, I was like it, the Slack channels where people were supposed to post their homework. It seemed like, like a water hose got left on overnight and it flooded the back. That's what those channels felt like to me. And I didn't even want to look at it. And so that's when I started thinking, I need to bring somebody else on. I've got to get somebody in here, like giving some reviews. And it was a, it was really helpful to have someone else come on. My, my first hire was this guy, Michael Rittering. He did amazing. I did like this huge interview process. I, I, I gave people like mock homework to critique in video form. And I would like giving them Amazon gift cards just for doing it. They try to find the, just the right person. This is an incredibly long explanation. No, I'm really curious about the details. And I love the idea of hiring and hiring people in the interview process is really quite interesting. And a lot of times, yeah, that's how I hire also. Yeah. So I basically was like, all right, Michael, check out this Slack channel. Like, don't get too scared. There is a pieces of homework and like, I don't care if you do loom videos. I don't care if you do want to do written content. I just want these students to feel like they have someone they can hear from. And so for, it took maybe like two or three months of him working every day or every week, at least to get in there and kind of like catch everyone up and at least give everyone like a piece of feedback. And then I was like, oh man, this is great. I'm going to get like, I'm going to get like six more design advisors, maybe on a much, like, I think Michael was doing roughly 20 hours a week from, and I was like, maybe I could get like six more design advisors doing like maybe five hours a week or so, and so I did another big kind of like hiring outreach and I wanted it to be like a very, a very diverse amount of advisors, both in terms of not me and Michael are both white dudes. So I was like, that's enough for that for now. I also wanted to get like freelancers people. I had someone who was a product designer at Facebook, someone else who was at an agency, just a good mix of like really solid approach from all angles, advising on design because everyone has a slightly different angle in which they're going to give feedback. And so in my mind, this was like perfect. And so like for the second enrollment, I was actually actively promoted. You'll get feedback from all these design advisors. Then I have everyone listed out and, and it was, I thought it was going to be great, but what it did was it actually poured gasoline on a problem that I thought I had solved. The water hose turned into a fire hose. Oh my God, it wasn't water pouring into my backyard. It was actually gasoline. And then this new plant of mine was like a lighter. And, and so all of a sudden everyone is like posting even more, their expectations are even higher. And I made it like really nonchalant for the advisors. I'm like, yeah, come in. I want you to basically, it was like, I want you to try to do roughly 10 or 15 student reviews each week. You can do video, whatever, but there was no real like system in place. It was basically just students posting their work into a never ending feed of like Slack updates. Um, and I did have channels broken down into like modules and then it just became almost like unwieldy. It was like, no one could tell what was going on. None of the advisors knew if another advisor had already begun reviewing someone's work. None of the students knew when their work was going to get reviewed. Everything was getting lost in the mix. And then I had like some advisors needed to like take a two month break. Another one was like, oh, actually I can't be an advisor anymore. And I was like, oh my gosh, this is an absolute wildfire. And so I made a decision after six months, actually it might've been three or four months. I made this big announcement video and this really like as heartfelt of an apology as I could. And I even told people in the Slack group, I was like, if anyone, you know, we're way past the 30 day money back guarantee here, but I realized that some of you might've signed up just because you wanted all this feedback. So if anyone here wants to reach out to me and get a full refund, like I don't have any problem with that, just want to just let everybody know, like this is what I was expecting, this is what happened and I'm apologizing for this result because it was not what I intended. And so basically I was like, okay. At the end of June of, I think it was 2021, I'm basically stopping all design advising because it's just not working at all. And so I decided to create a new design advisor program that was actually a, it's like $99 a month currently. And it had like extremely rigid rules. Like you can submit one to two pieces of work each week through this Google form, and that goes into a notion database. And now my design advisors can check off whether they are reviewing it or not. And now that I have like, and I try to do the math based on like how many students the advisor could review and how much money that would cost me versus how much it would cost the student. And so that, that has solved a lot of the issues other than it's, I think it's probably, I don't even think, I know that it's costing me more money than it's making, I'm actually losing money on doing that right now. And so, but it's been such a, it was almost like, just thank God this nightmare is over. So I'm just going to like, let this ride out for a little while. Cause I think there's a lot of intrinsic value and like having the ability to get someone to review your work. When you turn on the gasoline fire hose, it also prompts you to really reconsider your systems. How are you going to adjust that? And it was like, you had unforeseen consequences for making promises that were difficult to deliver without a system in place. And now you've learned that you can do that. And like, like now you can decide, do I want to charge more for this? Is it worth keeping? I could charge more and actually make it, maybe it's profitable and this is a viable service. It's like maybe almost breaking even, which is totally fine. I really wanted this to be valuable for the students. And I know for a fact, if you have someone who is more experienced than you reviewing your work and giving you pointers, I mean, that is the ultimate for advancing your life. You're going to get better quicker. Absolutely. And so, cause I, I want people coming out of ship nudge to be amazing designers because that's kind of what they signed up for and I want to be able to say like, Hey, yeah, check out their work. Now they went through the course and this is what their work looks like now. So if people aren't getting better than, you know, then I'm not a good job with the content. So, but yeah, that's been a pretty big learning experience for the whole design advisor thing. And I think there's so many more directions you could take that with live cohorts instead of like monthly, month to month design advising something that I would be interested in exploring in the future, but yeah, it's, there's, yeah. It's been a lot. And so I've enjoyed like letting things simmer down and have a, and finalizing the system a little bit better before I venture into a new thing. If you're going to make a new large scale course, would you use notion again today? I probably would. I mean, there's other, like there's teachables and podias and all the way up to, and including like hiring a development team and designing your own platform, which I feel like would be something that they would pull at you a little bit. But you didn't do that. Instead you've used notion. And I think that's interesting. It was the first time I'd ever seen anybody use notion to deliver a course. And I was like, Oh my gosh. And since taking your course, we are using notion as a beta testing ground for those courses because it is like really great for that. But then like going all in and saying, this is my course platform that we're not quite there yet, but I think it's really fascinating and curious about that experience. Yeah. I think that notion is not great for larger, more scalable courses, things that you would want to scale. Their API still does not work with like automated invites. So every single person that has ever joined Shivnaj, I have manually added them to the notion guest list. And that's been quite the, quite the task. I'm still doing that myself every single time. And what's funny is when I built, when I did my first course in 2015, before I launched that course, I also designed and developed my own course platform. So you've been down that road. Yeah. I went down that road and I had a developer partner because I'm not a backend developer. Yeah. At some point you got to have a database if you're doing that. So yeah, yeah. We had this, we had a really sweet little system. It's still a great, like the student experience, it was like tracking progress. It was a great little like student experience, but it didn't handle like chargeback, like all the things that go along with like some kind of credit card processing thing was just like a nightmare and yeah, so there was a lot that I needed from my end on the admin side and I was like, I can't bug my developer every time I need this tiny little change push to the code. And I think that's what, I think that's what led me to using Notion was because I had that experience last time and I tried to get so automated and so fancy and so technical and so complex with my system that I lost sight of traffic and. Customers. And when you get bogged down into building your platform and building your system and the technical aspects, cause it's kind of fun in some ways. And oh yeah, absolutely. It's a trade off and you're detracting from something else you could be spending time on. For sure. And it was like, as a designer who loves to build things, I'm like, man, this is great, this is such a cool, how I'm writing all the front end code and I'm just having a blast, I'm like, wait a second, this is, I'm losing focus here. But then we were like, oh yeah, we could, maybe we'll turn this into software and then we'll try to find, but that's like, Oh, now you're going to white label it and distribute it. Exactly. And we went down that road a little bit too. And then ultimately just kind of was like, this is not working out. I really just want to get a successful course going first. And then I did that kind of desire to build some kind of like course platform was still kind of like flicker in the back of my mind, but I'm not sure if I'll ever want to go down that road or not. Well, that's what I was wondering too. Now that you have like fully vetted Shift Nudge, like you've gone through all this feedback loop, you've had all this, is Shift Nudge going to stay on Notion or would you be tempted to like evolve that into, to something else or like the, I guess, or work on something new? Yeah, I think, I think that, uh, if Notion added a number of features that made it maybe easier to manage the kind of like the people who could view things and like feedback, like even the feedback stuff, like, like you can't get that level of integration that might be nice for your learning. Right. I think, I think for, for what I did and what I'm doing now, it's still working and I'm, I feel like it's a bit of like scotch tape and bubble gum right now, but that's okay. And I think if I, I'm definitely planning to, I always wanted Shift Nudge to be more of like the umbrella brand for new things. And so eventually I will likely come up with a new course under the Shift Nudge brand, but maybe the course that's now known as Shift Nudge, maybe it gets a new name or maybe it just is called visual design and there's another one called whatever. And so I think as that stuff starts to scale, it could, I mean, I know for sure it'll get more complex, but gosh, I don't think I want to go down the route of like building and developing my own software cause that's just a lot. It is a lot. It's super expensive too. And then you're maintaining that software over time, fighting software entropy and all that fun stuff that goes along with custom software. And I didn't understand that when I was a consultant, but for the last 10 years I've been paying, like writing checks for custom software and you're like, wow, this is very expensive. Yes, totally. And you're doing that instead of focusing on the teaching and the kind of this, like it's involved, everything's interweaved, but like the student outcomes, right, and if you can achieve student outcomes inside of a system like Notion that you don't have to also maintain, then like, is that enough? I've thought about doing other things that would maybe I, the student experience more than my own experience of like hosting a course. Like I thought about maybe I'll come up with some, maybe I'll get a developer to help me build some like really cool certificate of completion, authentication system, and there's maybe like, maybe we do like embedded certificates or some kind of like interactive thing that would be like cool and fun, that like, would be like a way that students could show off their certificates as opposed to me just sending them some PDFs. So little things like that would be a little bit more bite-sized, but I think that would add a lot more value, at least to the student experience, as opposed to like switching platforms, because they're going to be watching videos and reading content, no matter where the HTML is hosted. Yeah, exactly. Like it's a webpage and Notion is pretty good at building webpages, even though you can infinitely nest them and they get confusing if you are unfettered, you are using it in a constrained way that makes a lot of sense, I think. Matt, thank you so much for taking the time out. Thank you for creating Shift Nudge. It's helped me. It's helped my team and I know it's helped lots more people and we love it and love that you've created this and brought it into the world. So, so thank you so much. And again, thank you for hanging out with me today. Oh, thank you for having me. It's been awesome. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So, you built something cool and I really appreciate what you've done and I think there's a lot of interesting crossover between what we've done at Egghead and what UI.dev stands for and I feel like we have some similar goals but we've taken radically different approaches so that's pretty exciting to me. I am interested also in you personally, when you approach something new and complex, maybe a subject that you haven't delved into or a new domain, what's your learning approach, your personal learning style when you do research? What I love to do, and I've given this advice, I don't know if it's great advice or terrible advice, but usually what I do is Google for whatever the thing is, I think as a developer you get pretty good at Googling. Click on every link in the first two pages and just read everything, whether it's great or terrible. And then I think, at least in my perspective, what usually happens is you start forming this mental map of knowledge in your head. And then from there, you can kind of start seeing what's good, what's bad content. And then what's always helped me, and I think naturally is what I do for a living now, is if you approach it from the perspective, whether this is true or not, that you have to teach the thing, then I think that really helps because you're kind of forced to solidify those mental models of the thing you're teaching and really approach it from a first principles perspective. So that's what I do, is I don't care who wrote it, I don't care who created the thing, I'll read everything I can about it with the understanding that whether it's real or not, that I have to teach this thing. Do you approach it from a, you're just reading webpages or are you capturing those webpages somehow? I'm not doing anything. I'm the most least fancy. In fact, when I hear people like you and the Rome cult people doing all this crazy stuff, I can appreciate it, but yeah, no, I'm just, I usually have, for those watching or not watching, I have a pen and pad and I just write down notes. Old school paper. Exactly. Exactly. And it works for me. I think I definitely need to like modernize, but as you know, there's like so much friction in doing that. Oh, come on. I just clicked the Instapaper link, highlighted Instapaper, export to ReadWise, which brings it into Evernote, which I can then cut and paste into Rome. There's nothing complex about that at all, it's totally normal. You could be like James Long and have your front end is now grabbing it using a remix from Rome. I'm not going to get into like my conversations with James, but I'm so into what he's doing and he's giving me a little peek about how he's doing it and it's like the most exciting thing that I can even think about for six hours and everybody listening in the future would just be like, Oh my Lord, please. I believe it. I'm the exact opposite, complete opposite. James very smart. That puts me at the bell curve meme, you know, he's on the far right. I'm equally as good on the far left. We'll call it a day. Yeah, I mean, I love seeing an expert like that and knowing like this isn't, I'm not going to get there, right? I don't really even aspire to conjure up solutions in James Long, who does just all this really amazing work that I'm like, what is going on? I don't even understand that, but I'm so fascinated by people that do like the inventors, right? Like I'm not really an inventor. I've always described myself as a gluer and I can take several good ideas, glue them together and present it in a way that other people can understand, almost like translation. And that's worked for me as a consultant and it's worked for me in business, but like I love just the inventors and what they're doing. It's really, it's always inspiring and I love to just dig in and kind of snoop around and like for me and code stuff, it's like all the code, like I want to get in and I love reading source. Right. That's where I joined. Do you take courses? Are you a course taker? Ironically, I don't think so. Do you like video courses? It's so hard to really know. I think I like reading more. The multimodal, right? Like when I can watch a little something, if I feel like it or consume text. And I think it's contextual based, maybe, I'm maybe just making this up, but it feels like it may be in my preference, like more contextual based on what I'm learning. I can't define those lines right now. It's got to be like per topic. Yeah. Like woodworking, I really love watching videos as an example, but for coding, it's not my favorite though. If I have like a 2x, like I can put it on 2x speed and just like really jam through it, then I enjoy it a lot more. Maybe it depends on, cause I really love like a well-produced, like a high level, Hey, here's kind of the problem this thing's aiming to solve. Like those I love. It's the, okay, let's implement this like API and like it with video, it gets a little bit like hairy, as you know, maybe those, if we're in the weeds, I love text. If we're more high level than a well, well curated videos, probably. What would you say just basically makes a good course, regardless of medium or domain even what, what goes into creating a good course? So for us, what we've always tried to do is like really approach it from like first principles. Again, I'm going to say that a lot, cause that's tends to be my buzzword, but I always try to think of it as okay. When the student is done with this like course and we could even get into what that means. Cause I think that definition is all over the place. It's just been beaten into almost meaninglessness. It's like, it's like declarative, right? Oh, that's declarative. It's like, is it really declarative? Or we're just like using that to mean like good, you know? No, I mean literally. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And so for us, what we try to do is like really make it so it feels very linear and very well thought out. And for example, the example I always use is if at ever any moment where we have to go, okay, we'll come back to this later. Usually that I think of it, a course smell to, to, to use the play on words, right, exactly. If we could have spent more time on the outlining phase, maybe we could have gotten rid of that like weird kind of knowledge dependency, if you will. Right. So that's what we, that's what we spend a lot of time on is when we make our courses to make them feel very much like you're like walking up a staircase rather than rock climbing or use another like bad analogy. Right. So just having the flow of the course feel well to almost sort of when the student gets to the end of it, they're like, Oh, that almost felt like almost a little bit too easy because of the way the material was presented. And then it all layered on top of itself, if that makes sense. Yeah. The sequence of events was such that you never, there's always a little bit of struggle almost. And to me, and I've seen this comparison quite a bit like game design, right? Like where you intro it and you want it to be a little hard or it's boring, but just not hard enough to where you can't accomplish it and then you kind of ratchet up to a boss fight. Exactly. And I think the best educators are the ones who understand that and they really like embrace that. And that's what we try to do. Sometimes we don't, but like, that's always the goal is to make it, uh, have that vibe, if you will. Yeah. I think there's a lot of interesting things that you've done with your platform and how you present things. And I want to get into that. But first I was curious because you've kind of had a progression over the years where you've gone from kind of, you know, you've been an educator for a long time, right? Like you've been teaching people to code for years. What has been your progression through kind of platforms and technology and delivery and the way you've approached that? Right. So first started way back in the day, teaching in person at Dead Mountain. This was 2014. That's when I met John. Yeah. I remember that. That's when we first met too, I think. Yeah. And really got my, and I always go to Egghead to this, really got my online teaching chops at Egghead, right? Cause there is some similarities obviously when you're teaching in person and online, but it is completely different. Right? For sure. I was taught at Egghead for a bit, pivoted to do, start doing my own thing. This was like 2015-ish. Uh, ironically at the time it was still React. And then one thing led to another, had some fun with the React router guys for a little bit. Came back to do my own stuff. Uh, and now, now doing it with UI.dev. There's a lot of, we can obviously get into the weeds of a lot of that stuff specifically about platforms and all of those things, depending on which direction you want to take it. But that's the idea is you have been doing this since 2014, I think now across a variety of different mediums, different lengths. Now we're here. Just based on my observation and you went, you know, like the Egghead was that we're a platform and that's what we do. And we have a specific format that constrains you to, you know, like what we want to do. And our, our thing is kind of training trainers is a little bit of what we do and we've made a marketplace, which is certainly one way to approach thing and definitely not the other. And then you went to teachable, so you, they're kind of constraints. And then finally you've got to the point where you have constructed something that's bespoke to your needs and the needs of your learners and the audience that you serve. Why not just use an existing platform? Like why do something bespoke or would you recommend that? Or is the progression kind of, kind of important in terms of building what you've built? I think the, so ironically, whenever, like whenever someone asks you these kinds of questions, you usually just give the advice that you did. Right. So this is what I'm going to, this is what I'm going to do, but that's the asterisk on this. But so back in the day, really what I was optimizing for, and this was 2015 and I think the, I think it's still true with a few caveats, but like I was optimizing for making money and I don't think that's bad. I think that's, I mean, that's the point of a business, right? And so at the time it was okay, I could build my own platform thing or I could use a preexisting platform optimized for getting the first dollar and then figure out the platform later on if I needed to. And so that's, that's what I did and that worked out really well. We were on Teachable for, I don't know, four, three, four years. It was great in a lot of ways. It was miserable in a lot of ways, but what it allows us to do is like not worry about that and just worry purely about creating content and teaching. And that's what we did. It got to the point though, where obviously when you're playing in someone else's playground, like they make the rules and there was a lot of stuff we wanted to do, whether it was like MDX-y kind of like animation-y stuff, presentation stuff, like whenever you're with a platform, especially like Teachable, like they're not, pretty much for the three or four years that we were using it, it was like we were kind of hacking the platform to make it do what we wanted. Eventually it got big enough and had the resources where we could just roll our own thing. And that's eventually what we did. But I will say if you're just wanting to like optimize for selling something, probably the slowest approach to do it is like building your own platform. You may learn a lot. There's a lot of trade-offs there, right? You may learn a lot, you have full control, but if you're treating it like a business, you probably want to optimize for revenue first. If you're treating it as something different, which a lot of people may be, then like, yeah, you could roll your own thing. It's funny because when Egghead came about, Teachable didn't exist. And I did a Rails tutorial over like the course of two weeks and got from, it was Rails and Stripe integration. And that was, that was how it came to be, right? Like I didn't really have the option or didn't think of it at the time. And boy, it's, it's been a lot, right? Just because we still live with those same, it is evident in our entire platform that the core of it was built over two weeks in a, from a tutorial, kind of like JavaScript, right? Like the story of JavaScript. It's created over a couple of weeks and well, it shows still, it still shows. And that kind of thing is really interesting to me. Was it a struggle for you, like as a web developer to work in that environment over knowing that you could have full control if you just wanted to seize it or are you more practical than that? It wasn't because we were making money. That was the thing. Bootstrapping, you're thinking business over developer. We're thinking, thinking business, especially when I went full time on it. Like I, I had to put on the entrepreneur hat, not the developer hat. And I was able to like resist that urge for whatever, four or five years. Eventually it caught up to me. I respect that. But that's the reality, right? Is yeah, exactly. Like we needed to make money and that was the primary objective and building our own platform would have been fun and great. We would have learned a lot, had full control, but it like, who knows if we'd, I don't even know if we'd be having this conversation if I did that because who knows what would have happened if I would have spent six months building the platform before I like started selling anything. But you know, we're stuck on this one verse in the multiverse, but like on another timeline, you might've built something that'd be worse. And like that experience that you've gone through different platforms and learning what you've learned probably affected what you ultimately built when you did build something bespoke. I would assume. Right. I had, yeah. When we decided to do our own platform, I had a list of, I don't know how long, okay, so we wanted to do different than Teachable does. Because again, Teachable's built their, their platform. They have to build for the least common denominator, right? Where when we're building our own thing, we can build it however we want in the format that we like. Yeah. For better and worse, right? Yeah. And yours is like, like genuinely better, but I'm just saying, you know, we can do that. And sometimes when you do that, you might end up with, you know, functionally worse than what you could have just got off the rack. Even like around the edges, right? Because no one wants to do authentication flow, password resets, billing, right? All of those things. Full support, like all the accounting aspects of what you're doing. That actually, I was wondering, like, was there anything surprisingly challenging or were any aspects of that, like especially difficult or kind of jump up at you and you're like, oh, I didn't even think of that when you set up to build the platform? I guess it wasn't surprising because I kind of knew it going into it, but like authentication with, the way we authenticate, you know, the fancy websites nowadays is just pretty miserable. Specifically like with Next, right? If we're like SSGing everything, how do you like, you can't ship everything to the user because then like they're smart developers and they can go like, you can't have a client side thing there. Right? So like you have to do a server thing, put your SSGing stuff. So that's been our biggest struggle is like figuring out the eventual answer was to use like Cloudflare workers, you know, get the request and redirect from there. But that's been our biggest pain with the new platform is again, yeah, just all that like authentication-y, like the MDX stuff is fun. Like all of that stuff is really, we're building things like animation-y stuff is fun. Design stuff's fun, but it's like the edges. Okay. What happens when this weird use case happens or like someone wants to re-subscribe, like that's boring. No one wants to re-subscribe logic. It's always something. It really does. It branches. And then the users and the people subscribing are going to come up with, you know, all sorts of different ways that, and it's just meeting their needs. And when you're, you know, and then you have to build it basically. And we've always taken like maybe a little bit of a just-in-time approach and ignored some things that we knew we're eventually going to have to do just because, you know, it was a. I was just going to say what's interesting too is I've spoken with market front of masters. I don't know if it's still like this, but like a year and a half ago when I spoke to him, they're like, Hey, we rolled everything. We have servers in the back. Like we roll everything ourselves. I think it's just a huge trade-off. And the thesis, like the mental model we've always had is like, we're like educators. And if having a platform, exactly, if having a platform allows us to do that better than it does, but it can't come at the compromise of, okay, we don't ship content for a year. And that's kind of, we started this last year. Like we started kind of getting into that space of, okay, are we building a platform or are we like educating people? And it's so hard because once you do start rolling your own platform, naturally bugs come up, like all of those things, which takes away from like the core, you know, ethos of the business, which is like educating people. How do you balance that? This idea of, you know, like you're, it's a multi-sided marketplace in some ways, and you're building a platform and that's for you and your team. So really like your platform, your customers of your platform, and that's the same way that the learners are. How do you balance that between the creation of content and learning materials and all that? I don't, I'm still trying to figure it out, to be honest, because if you look at like our historically, like our content output, the last, like in the last few years is a good example where, and you can see it too in the numbers where we're very focused on producing high quality content. Things are going well. We shift into talking about producing high quality content as we work on the platform and then numbers start to like decline, right? Yeah. We've felt that also. Yeah. And it's such a trap. Let's stop talking about building a business and like just build the business. Right. And that's really the trap we fell out enough. Everybody does. It sounds like you guys did as well, but that's the trap we fell into the last year and a half is like getting off of teachable. Okay. Well, there's like these primitives. Now we've got to put in place with the platform and we're like pure developer mode now. Meanwhile, like we're not putting out content, we're not doing the things that like got us to where we were. And this really, this last six months has been trying to reset that, right? And go back to like our roots of, okay. It's really like the bell curve meme personified, unfortunately, but just getting stuck in the middle land, right? Oh, we should be A-B testing and we should be doing like meetings to talk about meeting sequences. Oh my gosh. It's the worst. And it's such a trap. Yeah, exactly. It's such a trap. And that's why now it's like, let's just get back to making great content. And that's really been the focus of, yeah, this last six months and so it's going well. Yeah. It's really difficult though. And it's always hard to balance. And there's not a lot of, there's not a lot of examples to look at. There's a lot of people talking about best practices and there's a lot of, you know, fluff on the internet and it's what's really important and what's the core of this business and is the core of our business, the platform or what is it? And one of the most interesting things I think about your, you know, like what you've built is you have a very limited set of courses, you know, you go to all these other places and we're all producing, you know, like here are 32 dozen courses choose your, you know, choose wisely where you have this like small set of courses and you know, it's not, it's not diminutive, but it's, you know, like it's just limited and focused, which I think that's really interesting actually. And probably a challenge, but also, I mean, I fundamentally feel it's probably a good thing in terms of, you know, your niche and focus and creating quality. And I was wondering, is that a conscious decision to have that kind of more limited, high quality focused catalog or how did that come out? It's definitely conscious. What we've always tried to do, cause again, like it's kind of core of the business, right? We're small, we're bootstrapped and to win in that with those constraints, you just have to be hyper-focused and it's kind of related to what we just talked about. Right. And I think that's one thing we didn't mess up on. We don't really care if we have an Angular course or like a view course, that's not who we are. We're not going to pretend we're Angular developers because we're not, we know nothing about Angular, but we know a lot about React. We know a lot about TypeScript and we know a lot about JavaScript, so we're just going to triple down. And luckily for us, because we're bootstrapped, there's plenty of market in just that, right? I always look at, you look at like Udacity and I know some of the numbers cause I worked with them and they're making a lot of money just from their React content. And that market share, just React, right? Just React is plenty of pie for us by the nature of like how we've structured the business. And so I think that's one thing we have done well on is just being very focused with, okay, if we make a course, let's make it the best we can. And we don't need to have a course about everything, but there are certain things that we need to have or at least try to have the best course on, right? TypeScript, React, JavaScript, nothing really, nothing else really. One of the interesting things that you've talked about in the past is this idea that, you know, like you, you aren't building a marketplace, right? Like Udemy or Pluralsight or Frontend Masters or even Egghead is absolutely a marketplace where you are going out and recruiting instructors to, you know, in-place content that then, you know, like the question is, and I think it's an interesting one that you've solved nicely is like, how do you maintain that later? Because you know, like our problem is people make stuff and then they, getting them two years later to update it is very much a cat hurting exercise and it's just how often it just doesn't even work. And I think that decision is interesting too. And it was that, you know, like where you have full-time employees versus, you know, bringing in contractors to create content, I assume that was a conscious decision as well. Yeah, it was very conscious. The idea there, it's so tricky because it very much limits like how quickly you can do things. But basically like I sat down and I was like, I don't know, based on what I know about creating content and creating courses, I don't know, I don't have the skillset to have someone not be full-time to do it, right? You guys have pulled it off well. It's so challenging. It's so hard, right? Like your full-time job essentially for a while there was essentially that, right? And I didn't want, I really think startups are like just choosing the problems you want. I didn't want those problems. The hard part there is, cause like philosophically that's fine, right? Bring people on. If they make content, they work full-time, they get salary, all those things. The problem is someone like Kent, for example, the incentives are pretty aligned with you and Kent because Kent can make a lot of money doing it well and then you could help him do that, right? But it's very hard. And Kent, as both of us know, has grinded for a very long time in getting to where he's at. He puts in the work. Exactly. And you can't hire a developer, one, because the developer has a very unique skillset where they can go and make a lot of money somewhere else, right? And so it's tricky because if you just hired them on a, paying them whatever an average salary, they're going to work here for two months, realize it's very hard to make high quality content and then just go back to being a developer and enjoying their life, right? So you have to do this thing where you have to align incentives with them and all of these things and what that eventually ended up looking like for us, because I'm not a big fan of bonuses and all that crap, what it ended up looking like for us was like, okay, instead of raising money and giving our equity away to VCs or angel investors, I just want to make it so if you come work here and you're in that grind with me, essentially building the business. Like if there is ever like an exit or anything, you have equity that's essentially meaningful for you. And, and it feels less like, okay, you're like working at you at a dev and this is also your thing. Yeah. And it's really easy to get to the point where like you're saying that and it's just words, right? But developers are smart and they know that they need to be on the cap table and have like significant equity, right? That's the only way it's worked for us is pay them a lot of money, give them significant and then just get them like on board. And it's so far, it's worked out fairly well. So we'll see, it's still too early to tell if that's the right, but it's, it's worked out fairly well. Yeah. And I mean, you kind of, I don't know, there's the, the personality side of it. And when you get somebody in there out there and they're doing their own personal content marketing and they're, you know, building a Twitter following and there's this, there's a lift, right? Like the audience lift that you get from that, but there's also trade-offs and that now you are kind of working around their schedule and you're absolutely right. Especially if you're talking about, you know, bringing in developers where the current salad table for developers is ranges from, you know, a hundred thousand dollars at the entry level to sky's the limit. It feels like sometimes, and, and, you know, it's okay, can you pause and do this thing and you'll make a little bit of cash and you can, you can get up and, and I had people before and we did this idea of West boss as a service, cause Wes has done really well and people see that and they're like, I want to, you know, I want some of that West boss action in my life. The reality of what Wes has done is incredibly hard and not everybody can do that. I don't, you know, it's like you just don't, it's a balance thing and you have to be very focused over many years like Kent has done and you know, it's other people too, but you know, it's not just, Oh, I can do this. I can take two months out of my life and bam, I'm going to be dropping an eight figure course on the internet. It just doesn't work like that. Kind of to switch gears. How do you approach instructional design? I know this is something that you think about a lot and it's one of my favorite topics to kind of nerd down on, but when you think about instructional design, what does that mean to you and how do y'all approach it at you? So the way we do it, and again, this goes back to what we talked about earlier, like this very linear approach to me, it's all, and I get it, this is like buzzword territory and I am known to do this, so call me out if I do it, but basically like it's, it comes down to what I think about as context, right? So whenever you get an introduction to anything, like this is your first time learning about like whatever props and react, whatever the subject is, we'll give you a video introduction to that thing. We'll give you a text introduction to that thing and at that point, the assumption is you don't need to know any other context around that subject other than what was in the course previously. Yeah. Right. So at that point you're like, okay, I'm feeling pretty good. I got a video. I got some tech. I, I at a high level understand what's going on. I feel like I know the thing. Maybe I don't really know it yet because I haven't done anything with it, but I feel like I, I at least know what this thing solves, like the problem it solves, it's use case, things like that. From there, we dump them into the quiz, which is just a generic, nothing really too fancy choice kind of quiz. Yeah, exactly. From there, what we'll do is we call it like a non-contextual, I call this cause I haven't figured out a better way to phrase this, but like a non-contextual like practice, right? Where, okay, let's stick with the props example. Here's a few like code sandboxes, the here's us like creating the element with react, we're passing some props. What you need to do is you need to grab those props, essentially display them in a certain manner, right? So it's, it's a very hyper-focused way to practice the thing that you were just introduced to, right? So there's, there's no state. There's not, there's no routing. There's nothing else. It's the thing that we just talked about and there's no other context you need other than to practice it. From there. Contextually isolated to what it is we just learned from the introduction, right? Exactly. Yep. From there, there's like a solution, which is basically just me walking through the solution. You get the code sandbox and everything. And then from there, what's interesting, what we try to do, and this goes back to what we talked about earlier with, which is like, we spend so much time trying to think of like how the course flows is what we try to do after that. Cause at that point you've seen, you've got like the non-contextual introduction, the non-contextual practice. That's good. But there's another step there, which is like seeing that thing in a bigger project, right? Cause you can't just play around with these non-contextual things. Cause eventually like, that's not how it works. That's not how the world works. Right? Yeah. So you go to work on Monday and guess what? It's very contextual. And so from there we throw them into a project that we've been working on the whole time. And then it tried to implement that thing in that project. So it gets a little bit tricky.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"tricky because like not only do you have to design a course that flows in a certain way, we also have to design like a sentence, like literally get like commits structured in a certain way so that as they're learning it, they could then take that and apply it to the bigger project. And essentially it's like rinse and repeat that for the entire course. And then at the end we have just like a project that they essentially recreate, which is everything they've learned up until that point. When you're making the projects, is that, are you putting on like a web application architect hat at the same time as a learning designer hat? Exactly. Because it needs to be authentic too, right? Like this, it can't be totally contrived. It needs to be something that they might encounter is the shape of a professional problem. Usually the way it works is like I'll put on the developer, yeah, the architecture hat, I'll build the project and then I'll put on the education hat and okay, how can we essentially rip apart this project to where like, what would a normal Git commit flow look like for this project? And can we then align that and map that to our like course material? Kind of like reverse engineering, but with learning design thrown into the mix. Is that something that like, is that typically you doing that or do you compartmentalize that process to where, you know, somebody is building the example, somebody is breaking the example down or is that a collaborative or a single person? It's usually a single person, which is then goes back to the equity thing, the incentives thing, because that whole process is a very, that's a whole thing. It's a process, right? It does not just conjure itself out of thin air. It is something that requires expertise, experience, and lots of, well, lots of context, I guess. Right, right, right. And yeah, it's hard to do that. And you have to have a lot of patience and all of those things, right? And it goes back to like, okay, how do you find those people? That's also tricky, right? And then so anyway, that's how we structure it. It's had pretty good results. And that's, again, going back to building the course platform, we were able to kind of design the course platform around that idea. And so now all of our courses kind of follow that same model. You put in reps and then like you were putting in reps on the content side of it before you built the course platform. So you kind of had, this is how our content structured. This is effective for people that are using it. Therefore we can put this together in terms of, in the context of our course platform. And now we have the presentation that we were hoping we've always wanted as well. So you're kind of layering on that, iterating on an idea where at all times it feels like to me, learner outcomes and learner success is the key to literally everything. Right, exactly. And I think we were able to do that because we suffered on Teachable for so long, to be honest. Yeah. And that's pretty good. Like you're over there, this is what we don't want. We know everything we don't want and the little handful of things that we do want. And then you're also able to observe across other platforms too. And these are the patterns that we think would be great for us. And then I feel when I did Egghead and it was like Rails was my choice. And these days, you know, like between, I don't know if you use any no code visual programming tools, but, and we're programmers, so we can take a perspective on it and use like Next.js and all that fun stuff. But I'm like amazed at what is available now in terms of putting together, you know, the modular pieces that, that assemble into your Voltron platform, right? Like it's, it is a really cool landscape right now for doing that sort of thing, I think. Yeah. I'm a big, I think this idea of like developers who leverage no code or like low code, I feel like that's so underrated. Like actually moving that direction in a lot of ways, just because it's the best. Yeah. We're throwing everything at Zapier that we can, because you just get so many benefits from it and the downside's fairly limited. And yeah, that's, we're huge fans of it, especially again, going back to the ethos of, okay, we're here to make money. We're not here to like nerd out about platform stuff. I don't care. I don't want to write a node server that has like scale and I don't want to do, you know, I don't want to have a distributed server using all these, like, whatever. I just want like, let's throw it at Zapier. It obviously it has to be performant, all of those things, but that's essentially the ethos is like, we're here to build a business first. And that's kind of been core for what we've done. I mean, let's face it. Like a learning platform is not a bank, right? So we have different needs and different, you know, like transactional capabilities and just even scale issues that are way smaller than something like that. And you know, it's like learners and it needs to work right and it needs to be performant and people have expectations just based on their use of the internet. And we had developer audiences, so they're even a little more persnickety than maybe some folks would be, but it's like that problem space really lets you think about it. And I love that idea of like developer second, educator first. I think that's a, it's a kind of a force multiplier in the business and maybe a great way to think about it. I think it's good for hiring too, because it's very clear. Okay. Are you like, if they don't align with that, then it's not a culture fit for lack of a better word on both sides. Right. And if they do, then it's all great. There's probably not many other places in the world that's going to be a better fit for you than what we do. Yeah. So that's, people have resonated with that. So I was interested in this idea of contextual and non-contextual practice and is that something that you've kind of synthesized or does that come from previous experience or education or was there a book that got into this? I honestly think I made it up. I'm sure I'm not the first one to think of it cause it's not super novel, but I literally, we were trying to write copy for like our landing page one day and I was like, I don't, there's not a name for this. Like we just, I think it happened naturally. Like the example is not very good copy. Yeah, exactly. That's a, that's a great way to put it. Turns out developers don't like that. So yeah, I don't know if I'm sure I had inspiration somewhere. I don't even know. I honestly think the first time I did, or one of the first times it probably happened cause it probably happened by accident where I was like, Oh, we just did this practice and now like in the project, this is what we're doing next. And I was like, Oh my gosh, that's great. You know, that's honestly, that's probably what happened is probably all by accident. And then I just put a name to it for marketing purposes. I actually Googled contextual practice and it has something to do with the art world and around the depression. There we go. Yeah. And I was like, I don't think that's it. Like it was, this is not the thing. That's how you know. That's how you know. I just pulled that out of my book because I did not come up with that. One of the interesting things is that you've long done this and ever since you were, you've been producing your own learning content, you've had a guarantee associated with it, a guarantee that this is going to be up to date. And I think that's fantastic. And I was wondering, you know, is there a process to maintaining them or what triggers an update or how do you look at that and maintain these courses over time? It is, and it really goes down to, again, like the very methodical approach we've taken to the business. Because if you have, if you're outsourcing content, it's much harder to do that, right? Because then you have to essentially convince someone to do that, or you have to swap that out with something new, which is then you just convincing, as you know, you just committing someone else to do that. We were, because we took the approach of like, okay, only full-time people make content. We were kind of uniquely positioned to be like, okay, well, if it's our full-time job to do this, then we don't have an excuse to not keep it up to date. It's just what we do. And then from there it's, okay, well, how are we going to know if something goes out of date? And then the only answer there is be very involved in the ecosystems of the things we teach, which is why we really only teach a few different. That's where the constrained course catalog really becomes an asset to you because now you're not having to track literally the entire scope of web development. You are like, this is our section. This is the good stuff. Exactly. Just, just react, just TypeScript, just Java. And it's all, those are all the things we care about and are like passionate about anyway. So it's not really like hard to figure out when something goes out of date because we're going to naturally see it anyways, because that's kind of all we do. Yeah. Yeah. We tracked Angular through the whole move in there and just, you know, and then we ended up with this sprawling catalog where, you know, like you go through it and it's just, there is no keeping up. And then we end up having to rely kind of on learners raising flags is at one point we were able to pretty much monitor it. And then at some point it hit the tipping point where there was just too much. And now it's, we rely on that and we go back through and review when somebody raises a flag, but it's a whole, now we have a whole process around, you know, like the tending that sort of garden, which wasn't intended, right? Like I think. Again, there's a lot of benefits to that, but there's some, you just chose different problems than I chose. Yeah. It's trade-offs all the way down. Like it's trade-offs. And I have said this, I would never like knowing what I know now would not build an egghead like in the way that we have become. And I still think it's good. And we do a lot of interesting things. It's just, if I was choosing down mostly with my business hat and kind of instructional designer hat, I'd be like this, I would do this way different, you know, it's not Netflix for nerds. It's some sort of other. Right. Right. Right. You know, like whatever it might be. So I want to kind of flip into, you know, a little bit about the development of content and how you think about maybe even a little bit of the marketing side of it. And when somebody comes, when a learner comes to UI.dev, what is the difference they're trying to achieve in their lives? What's the primary driver that you've seen over the years for people trying to get through this stuff? Right. We haven't, again, going back to what we talked about earlier, like understanding a user is very important and it's good, but there are only like a few of us and we're like really heads down with content. So it's really hard for us to like, we do one-on-one onboarding calls with everybody who signs up. So that's been super helpful, but we haven't, there's not a strong pattern there, right? Like sometimes we get backend developers who get thrown into a React project and they got to learn React. Sometimes it's a bootcamp grad who they skimmed over React, but they want to get deeper into it. Those are usually the patterns. A React developer who all of a sudden they are using TypeScript at work and now they got to learn TypeScript, right? It's usually the biggest pattern is that someone usually has a pretty strong need, right? Usually it's not. They're trying to solve something right now, basically. They're trying to solve the problem, which is a great person. It's a great place to be as a business if you can essentially answer that, right? Because we're not having to prove, we're not having to educate around the problem. The problem's already clearly there and it's in everybody's best interest to solve that problem. And so that's been really nice, which is why we don't spend a ton of time thinking about that side of things, just making the best courses we can. Because by the nature of that, usually people will find us for a variety of different ways if they have a specific problem. Have you learned anything surprising or interesting from those conversations that you have with onboarding? I would assume so. But I feel like you are doing that with those calls. And I'm wondering if you've had anything that's been like, wow, we didn't even think of that or just what's the benefit of doing these calls in the first place outside of like you're helping them, but what's the business benefit that comes out of it? The business benefit is it's so surprising to people because no one really does that at this level. If you're like a whatever B2B SaaS, it probably makes sense. White glove onboarding, right? Exactly, exactly. If you're paying someone 40 bucks, which is what they're paying us, or a yearly subscription, no, it doesn't really do that because that doesn't really scale. But again, not to throw out Paul Graham, but the do things that don't scale, it's worked out fairly well for us. I mean, this is another one of those examples where because we're so small, bootstrapped, we can't afford to personally onboard people and it does work out well. And we do get to learn about the user. So to answer your question specifically, it's been interesting to see, because we have courses, we also do events, which are essentially like your verbiage earlier, like Netflix for developers in a different sense than what you guys do. And it's been interesting to watch some people, the majority of people sign up for courses, but some people are just there for the events because they're not necessarily, it's usually the more experienced developers. They don't necessarily want to take a course, but if Sunil or John from CloudFlare is coming in to talk about CloudFlare, that's really interesting to them and they want to be there. So that's been fun to watch. Other than that, it's mostly just good to understand the problems people are having. Essentially like personalize their flow through the product about how they can solve those problems. Yeah. Here's where you can start and here's, you know, like vaguely get to where you're going. Right, exactly. And that kind of avoids having to have this like, this learning path algorithm-y thing that you do if you can just do it manually. That's another advantage to the constrained catalog too, right? Like the catalog is the path. It's not like you have to carve a path through here. There's, you know, start here and end here and you're pretty much going to get the full map that we offer. It's fairly clear. Yeah. It's fairly obvious what you need to do. Have you had any like major success stories? Like anybody, like just kind of blown your mind over the years or got like feedback from users where they've gone through this and it's changed their lives in some significant way? Yeah. It's always like the, either I got a job or I got a raise. I think, and you probably see that as well, where it's funny because it feels so small because you're like, Oh yeah. Like, thanks. Thank you. Glad you enjoyed it. Right. But it's not that fundamentally pivoted their entire life. It's like this thing you did for them. And so it's, it's just fun to be in a space where that is almost kind of like a, the normal result, not maybe not normal, but that's a fairly common result of the input, right? Which is just, which I feel like we're very spoiled by because again, if you're selling like, you know, B2B SaaS stuff, like you're not really doing that at all. No, I agree with that. You just, you kind of drop in there, their B2B ocean and you're not seeing those individuals and you can help businesses. It's not that you can't, it's just, you don't see that kind of personal individual success story where you, when you're, you're teaching people like that, you really got a taste of. And even like years later too, I'll get messages now that say, or I'll do a YouTube video and the one in the comments will be like, Oh, like I took Tyler's course in 2017 and now I'm a whatever, whatever at whatever company, right? Like even, even just those small things are still just super rewarding because it, yeah, you're just able to just a little bit move people in the direction they want to go and it compounds and yeah, it's super rewarding. So, so your, your newsletter bites is great and people love it. And I see it, you know, like it's constantly like every time it's released, there's like a wave of people that just adore it. And I'm like, is this something that you're setting aside specific time? Are you like timeboxing this or what's the like development process? And I'm kind of making assumptions. Do you write it or is it a collaborative effort or how does it, how does it work? Yeah, it's definitely collaborative. So Alex Brown who works with us, he owns it and that's kind of the vibe of the whole company too is we're so small that you really just have to take a certain thing and like own that thing. Bites is his, React content's mine, Alex Anderson has the TypeScript content, stuff like that. And so the way it works is he'll spend, I don't know, three or four days a week, maybe sometimes even more, he spends usually a little bit of time like figuring out what topics are happening that week. For example, this last week was the fun one of like next verse remix. So just getting the kind of all the context of what's happening there, writing a fun little story from there and Alex Anderson helps with him that as well. But basically from there he gets at the point where he's okay. To me, this feels like it's ready to ship. At that point he gets it to me. I'll spend a few hours on. What's nice about that point is I can come in just with like jokes. He can get the meat of it. Colored coffee, I think is the term. Exactly. I can just, I could come and just, yeah, just be funny, which is fantastic because like I could just drink caffeine and be funny and luckily it works out fairly well. And then that's usually the process, right? We try not to overthink it again, going back to the just great content people love. And if we could be funny along the way, that's great too. And so that's the process. He spends, he spends a lot of time on it, gives it to me. My takeaway from that is that it is a very real and up priority in the literal sense of priority is it receives attention and it is a product that you apply a lot of effort to and think about as a company wide priority. It's up there. It's up there with a top three priority. Distributions courses is one, like distributions one and really bites is like the lead with like distribution. So it's like, it's really, if not the priority, it's, it's number two. Well, I mean, email is a great platform and if you can use it in a way that respects users and respects their inbox and gives them something actually valuable in the sea of just nonsense that we get in our inbox, if you can be a highlight, like you really stand out and there's no other platform that converts people into customers at the end of the day. Right. Right. Or even just like brand advocates. Right. Which like humor is a fantastic way to do that. Absolutely. Turns out people love it. And even, even if someone never even buys a course, what's nice about bites is like they could still at least realize on a weekly basis that we exist and that's, I mean, that's marketing, right? Like that. In a very authentic way too. Cause you're, it's like a journalism approach and kind of, you're doing a little lampooning in there as, as well, but you're, you know, it's like a, it's, it's journalism and you're out there coming up with stuff and sharing the important stories, putting a light twist on it so that it's fun to consume. And I think that's, it's really a service that you're, you're offering people and it's at no charge, but you know, it's like, it is valuable and receive that value and then reciprocate at some percentage over time. But it's, I don't think you can do that if you're just trying to like market to people through your newsletter. Definitely not. And it's been fun. It's, it's fun too, because so much has, I mean, as you've seen this conversation, like so much of the education-y, business-y side of things is so serious and it's so dense and so boring and to be able to be fun for a few hours a week, it's fantastic. And even, you know, I feel like even developers, right. We're so serious so much of the time, that I think that's why people- Trying to find flaws in everything. Exactly. As a job, right? Yeah. And I feel like that's why people love it because it's just not that. We don't take ourselves too seriously. Like we make fun of technologies and it's fine because we kind of just make fun of everything. And there's like clear limits that we don't cross, but like for the most part, it's okay to make fun of Remix and Next and like- The tech, not the people that are making it. Exactly. Because people are really working hard on all this and everybody- A hundred percent. And I think there's ways to do that. And even just like making fun of developer culture in general, I feel like people love it because for the most part, we take ourselves way too seriously. Well, Twitter is a fire hose of potential content for that newsletter, I suspect. It is. It's the best. It's the best. Yeah. Has anybody been mad if you had to have any tough conversations over an issue of bytes? The biggest thing in the early days is just because it's a bunch of dudes making it. Yeah. And it wasn't bad. Like for example, this is a good learning point for people. Our headline was, so basically what we'll do for the title, very unscientifically, is we'll take a random text from the newsletter and just have it be the title. And so there was a line in there about like Pretty Hurts, which is a Beyonce quote. And so that was the title. So then a woman messaged us and like, Hey, this isn't necessarily bad, but just the perception could be bad. Yeah. Right? Like this idea of like Pretty Hurts, whatever. We don't need to go into it. It's in a direction you don't want necessarily. Exactly. And I was like, Oh, that's fantastic. And that's not, one, it's not even a good joke. And two, she's totally right. And we didn't see it because we're, you know, a few dudes making this thing. So stuff like that's been the biggest, but yeah, we've surprisingly been able to, maybe not surprisingly, because we do have very clear lines of what we make fun of. We haven't had any real issues that I'm aware of, at least that have been brought to my attention. Other than like those little small ones. It's like, Hey, just so you know. Yeah. Well, that's just good feedback too. I mean, like, that's like, thanks for looking out at that point. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. And since then we haven't had, we haven't had any other ones like that. What's the most audacious goal that you and the team have for you and Ed? We would like, so again, going back to like, which is a very ironically, maybe ironically, like philosophically different than Egghead, unless you've changed your opinion, which I don't think you have, because you wouldn't be sitting where you are. In order for us to give away equity, there needs to be an assumption that this equity is going to be worth something one day, right? Egghead, at least historically, has been very much not that. Well, our contracts are weird to where selling the business is. Like you don't want to sell. Yeah. I don't know if you're right. I don't know if you're as passionate as that today, but in the back of the day, you're like, no, we're not going to sell. We're building a business that, you know, we want to run the rest of our lives, which is very commendable. When you're giving equity to people, there's, you can't really have that stance or else it's like, okay, I don't, equity is essentially worth this, right? And so that's probably the biggest goal is like, just create a bootstrap, a company that one day we sell and everybody is happy with that sale because they have equity. What that looks like, obviously like it's, that's a whole nother conversation to have, but like that's eventually the goal is to make it. So like the people who took the chance coming here to get equity, we'll eventually reap that reward. So in retrospect, I think that is a better way to design a company from a business and like contractual and legal structure set up with this idea that we might at one point have the option to have a liquidity event versus I am going to scuttle this entire operation from the very beginning to where it would be impossible to ever sell it because that's how I feel when I'm 37 versus when I'm 47. And I don't know, I'm just saying hypothetically, like there's different ways to look at that. And you know, hindsight is always 20-20 and I'm still pretty firmly in that and like Egghead will exist, but it's like, it is definitely, there's trade-offs to both ways. Right. Right. And I think if that never happened, then I've always said too, I've always liked to just pay people a ton of money because hopefully we're making a lot of revenue. If your equity is not worth anything, then like maybe one day it will just pay you a ton of money to make content and learn things and you'll enjoy that as well. Yeah. I mean, sure. You know, dividends is a thing too, right? That is very much a thing. Ironically. Like it's, that's not bonuses. That's okay. We have liquidity and we're going to spread it across our shareholders whom, you know, if you're giving equity would be the people that are actively developing, which is not the same as some sort of major transition where Pluralsight buys UI dev and absorbs it into their catalog, which. Right. Right. Not going to happen. Yeah. Pluralsight. Yeah. But don't come looking at my door either. Tyler, it was really great to chat with you. I really appreciate the intention at which you've designed this entire operation and the business and the quality and learner outcomes. I think it's incredible and inspiring and, and Frank, frankly, like I think it's, you're just adding to the whole mix and I think it's just great. So thanks for taking the time to talk to me. Of course. It means a lot. \")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"You are talented and interesting and we've worked together on Egghead and it's been like a pleasure to watch you go from an intern at a company to a professional software developer and educator and sharing your knowledge. And that's something that I personally enjoyed watching. And we're going to talk about some of that. And specifically, we're going to talk about the course platform and course that you're developing. But the first thing I wanted to kind of kick it off with was how do you approach learning a new complex topic? Like when you sit down to learn something, it's difficult, you know, you have a hill to climb, how do you approach learning something complex? I think for me, my, my best learning is done by doing, which I don't think is totally unique, but I feel like I hit walls when I'm trying to learn something and I, I spin wheels just kind of reading or memorizing, or it was the same thing for me in school, like going through university where I felt like I didn't learn until I did homework. So most of the time in class, I'd sit there and do my homework while the teacher was lecturing, because I felt like I could actually connect the dots that way. And so that leads me to where, yeah, when I'm interested in doing something, I have to look up a lot of info, kind of do a lot of reading, that's like a preliminary step, but I don't feel like it's ultimately learned until I've like done something with the knowledge. And, you know, if it's something physical using my hands and actually like touching and feeling, if it's, you know, writing code, which I do a lot of and trying to learn some new tool, library or language, then I think I have to build something and it can't really even be something trivial either. It almost has to be something that I like intend to use. So I feel like I build a lot of small trinkets and gadgets and tools that have really helped solidify the things I actually feel like I learn and get better at, but yeah. Do you, do you reach for books or what's your research process like when you, you said you, you read a lot and I'm wondering, you know, like a lot, like there's the web and there's books and there's different ways to think about reading and research and I'm wondering, what does that process look like? I think I read a lot. I do read a lot of books. I feel like I, I want to consume from multiple mediums or multiple media, whatever the plural of that is. So yeah, if it's books, I feel like maybe it depends on what I'm trying to learn, what I'll reach for. When it's cooking, I'm happy to watch a YouTube video because I can see somebody doing something and you know, I can mimic the behavior. I feel like when it's a more like complex thing that I feel like will take a deeper dive, I want to, I want to hear what like four or five people have to say about something and that could be reading books, blog posts. Are you much of a course taker? Do you buy like online courses and take them or watch them or read them or do them? Yeah. Yeah. I am definitely, and I feel like the value I get out of courses ends up being like, there's a couple gems in each one. You know, I think I'm also not unique in that I buy a lot and don't finish a lot of them because I, I don't know. Finishing is always the, always right. I mean, it's finishing the goal, right? Like it's what you want to get what you need out of it, not necessarily finish the course. Right. Totally. Like same thing with the book. Like I don't finish tons of books. I don't think unless they're like fantasy books, I want to get to the end, but I tend to like read to get the ideas I feel like I was there for, and once I feel satisfied with those, like move on to the next thing and, and yeah, I'm kind of like antsy to try. I was going to say, what are the, like the qualities of a really good course? When you take one and you're like, wow, that was great. What are some of the qualities that you've noticed? Um, the, I, I really noticed like the small details and I think it's like really intentional thought into the content. I mean, the content is really what I'm there for. And if it's been well thought out, I feel like there's like a logical flow of ideas where I can start at the beginning, go to the next thing and it kind of like piece together, like, like I'm following. Like building a Lego and it's step one, step two, step three, there's complex ideas that aren't like numeric steps, but I think a good course, like somebody that really knows the material can turn it into something that almost becomes that for you, where it's like step one. It's like, oh yeah, that's easy. Step two. Oh yeah, that's easy. I just take one and add two. Oh, step three. So if I like take a course and I, and I feel like, oh yeah, this is kind of easy. I think it's done its job for me. And that maybe is different by every, the level of the learner taking a course, but when I'm following something, if I like feel smart doing it, I think maybe it's stroking my ego a little, but it, I think it also shows that like an expert has made something complex, simple, and really knows what they're doing. So you've built UI foundations and it's a design course specifically focused on building beautiful UIs and that's what you're teaching folks how to do. And when somebody comes to that, when a learner comes to UI foundations and they're interested in what you have to offer, what are they trying to achieve? What do you feel like is the difference in their lives that they're trying to accomplish? I would hope that somebody who comes to UI foundations, kind of like the target audience of what I've been building for is almost like the vague ambiguous parts of design that you almost like can't point at and like we can point a homepage of a website and say like, Oh yeah, that looks good. But it's almost hard to like quantify why. I think what I'm hoping people learn as, as they go through the content and can like interact with it is that there's stuff that you kind of can't quantify. There's like rules that you can and lines in the sand you can draw that is like, this is good most of the time with some caveats always in design because it's an And if you follow this, like you're probably going to end up looking pretty good and if you follow this, you're going to, this is a good input to your output. If you kind of take these inputs and understand some rules about like how colors work together and how spacing and, you know, contrast and all sorts of these like design principles that kind of make like little pieces, it's almost like trying to arm learners with, with a bunch of, I mean, I named it foundations because I think that it's like pretty fundamental stuff, it's not like super new and novel, a lot of like the design principles I'm trying to like teach, but I'm trying to make them like practical and give like some actual opinions and rules to say like, do this, don't do this. And if you do, I'm willing to bet what you come out with, if you're trying to design something yourself, will look pretty good, so. I think one of the cool things that you've done is created this kind of interactive environment where you're not just, it's not a book and it's not a video course, but you've given people an environment where they kind of can get in there and touch and feel the design process in a way that feels pretty, pretty real. And I'm wondering, you know, like how has that approach helping people achieve their goals and why have you kind of chosen to take that extra effort to make those interactive examples? Yeah, I think for me, it felt like a pretty natural fit to say that if I'm teaching design, it's, you know, you can look at it, you can see it, you can see a design that's good and I can look at a design and I can see that it's bad. And there's like this in-between state, like how do I take it from bad to good? And one of like the most common interactive things I have throughout like the course is this like little example pane that I have where I put like a UI inside it and I like throw some bullet points next to it. And when you click a button, it'll animate from like a bad state to a good one. And it's not necessarily always like bad and good. That's, it's kind of subjective, but there's like that ground in between a bad design and a good design where people throw up their hands when they're looking at something and say like, why does it look good? Like, what's my problem here? And if you have a book, you can kind of show like a good and bad side by side, but sometimes it's not always clear exactly, you know, it's almost like you play the game of like circle the differences between these two examples. And I'm almost like playing the game for you when you click a button and can kind of animate the difference between good and bad and emphasize some text and put some more color in somewhere. And then you realize like, oh, a different shade of tinted background actually like breathes some life into this. And all I need to add was that one thing. And I hope, and my goal, and it seems to resonate and land with a lot of people is that it makes it a lot like faster to kind of digest and get the gist of when you can see, okay, here's where we started. Here's where we ended. It does look better. And there wasn't all that much that had to change. It was a little tweak here. And then I just kind of categorize those into different rules and principles. And yeah. I noticed that you don't, cause in the ones, in the examples that I played with, it wasn't like good or bad. It was like less and more. So you're adding more to it and maybe this is too much and this is too little. And then there's kind of that Goldilocks in the middle where it's, this is the sweet spot, but like based on preference, you could move it a little bit this way or a little bit this way, and you're not going to ruin it, but you can, when you're at the extremes and it's, you know, like, that's not probably it. Right. And it pops back into the middle. And I really enjoyed that. Like, I thought that was a thoughtful touch. Cool. Yeah. I'm glad, I'm glad you did. How do you know when somebody is interacting with your site or they're a learner is going through the course. Do you have any way to know when they've been successful? Have you, I know you're still very in progress with this, but like what have you learned so far in terms of learner success and people going through it? I really wish I, this is something I've been thinking about and I think I need to find a better mechanism for gauging it. I have some like pretty rudimentary tracking inside of it, just to say like when stuff is marked as complete, I have, I have like some analytics in the background where I can kind of look at, I have some like quizzes inside there and kind of see when people are marking the wrong answers, almost like a teacher could kind of check a bunch of tests and see the grade distribution on like a particular question. So I would hope that those are over time going to lead me to say like, Oh, apparently this content leading up to this question didn't explain it in a way that led people to the right answer most of the time. So I think that's going to be very interesting over time as more and more people go through the content and kind of interact with it, I have had like a pretty one-on-one lines of communication channels with a couple of people going through that have, you know, I've just sat down and talked about their feedback and gotten responses about what they liked, didn't like that, that won't be scalable in the long run, but I really don't have what I feel like is a good mechanism to say they made it through and it was worth their money and I think that's a failure on my part. I hope that by the end they get to a certain point, but I don't feel like I have a great way of measuring that yet that I've quite landed on. I wouldn't call it a failure, Kyle. I would say like you're in a learning process yourself, right? Like, I think that's what's interesting because you are creating something and you're selling it, but you're also learning as you go, right? Like this is your first course and course platform, correct? Like you haven't created course platforms in the past and this is kind of an effort. And I think that's great. You said you were talking to people like learners as they go through in a handful of them. How has that feedback affected what you've made, if it has at all? It's made me realize that I apparently can't proofread my own work because there's a lot of issues in there. First thing I've learned. Apart from that, I've realized that, you know, everybody really is different stuff that resonates with some people, doesn't with others, like things that I've sometimes have gone through like three or four iterations on some of these little like examples I've made that I've kind of embedded inside blocks of texts to make stuff more interactive. And some people just say like, you know, I didn't really get this one. I thought it looked about the same between both states, right? I didn't quite get the point. And yeah, it's a little bit harder than I thought, where sometimes the things in my head, I don't quite get out into the right format to explain it well or right. And that's been a challenge. I think for sure there's a big variety of people that have kind of signed up in little like pre-release period that come from kind of different backgrounds. And I think it was a bit of a, at first I was almost like firing darts at the wall of like what kind of developer or designer I was targeting, if it was really more developers and more designers. And I think I've landed somewhere in the middle and those people come with different backgrounds and I've assumed some knowledge in places that, you know, a different kind of learner just doesn't have and needs to like, I need to give more context some places, but not give too much context to bore other people. And a lot of those things have become challenges, but they're interesting challenges and they, I've liked having my own course platform to find nice ways to solve them where I can hide context inside tool tips and dropdowns and you know, let people skip content when they need to. And yeah, you get that, you get that control. Yeah. Hard to fire wide, but great to have the control to know that I can like adjust the levers where I need to. Do you have any sort of approach to instructional design that you've been taking or is it just kind of taking your knowledge and applying it? I don't think I've really had much of a framework for thinking. I think a lot of it's been a bit of like intuition I've started gaining from like writing docs and tutorials and content and stuff like that over time. And yeah, I've kind of trusted my gut that the stuff that I've learned well with other people will hopefully resonate with and followed an approach where I try and deliver things a couple ways. And with like a couple examples, I would say that's like one kind of core philosophy of trying to follow is rehashing stuff a couple of ways, you know, introducing a principle in the first module and then a couple of modules later, kind of bringing it back up to like nail it home, like this is where that idea and this idea synthesize. And then, yeah, hopefully having enough good examples that, you know, something sticks. You touched on this a little bit and I'm really curious, why not use an existing platform like a Teachable or a Podia or something that you could just go and you didn't have to bother with all the kind of technical stuff in terms of your own platform? I considered it, but I think part of the thing that I love most, and I think the thing that the really like the killer feature, the thing that I feel like is most valuable about what I've been building is that it, it can be, there can be a lot more in a little, like less can be more in, in what I'm able to build where I've done like screencasts and I've written long form content and stuff where you can embed things and it's good. And you can explain things. Well, I don't think it's a bad approach, but I, I felt like all of the design content and things that like I had learned from like blog posts on medium, YouTube channels that teach this stuff, like websites with, you know, this kind of content. It, I learned almost more like tweaking around with like color tools on the internet than I have, like reading a blog post about color theory. And I felt like there was some hybrid of it that I couldn't get like building on Teachable or just recording a bunch of videos and, you know, putting them wherever that I hoped would make the. Like the learning journey a little bit more, it's kind of like a bit, the egghead idea of like, let's make it short to the point and respect the time of the person learning. I, I think that you can learn a lot more with one really nicely done example with some knobs you can tweak because you know, I get to put as the learner, I get to adjust the knobs. I get to look at the things that I don't understand and be like, well, what does that change? And move a slider one way and watches like this graph changes and, and teaches you something. And some of the knobs I can ignore in a video. I feel like you have to watch every single one of the knobs be turned and four out of the five knobs already knew what they did. And by the time I get to the fifth, I'm bored of the video. So I think in that regard, it puts you in control a little bit as you're going through. And I didn't feel like I could get like a super fine grained controller, like a handle on that, unless I did it myself, which is, you know, like maybe the following. It gives you just the full control and right. Well, I mean, you can, so that, that's one thing because you have the technical capabilities to do it. So I did it cause I can, it's actually a pretty, pretty solid answer in general, but then you get complete control and you're able to design something more, more related to your customers and the vision you have of teaching them. That, that sums it up pretty well. Has there been any surprising challenge like technical or otherwise, as you've built your platform and delivered it that you've run into, or has it all been pretty ordinary for you? Technical challenge. I don't think I've run into anything too like surprising. There have been small challenges in places where I start putting my engineering hat on and go too far in the weeds on how to start building tools to fix my other tools. I've tried to keep it simple. I knew that I would get distracted if I spent too much time building the platform versus writing the content. And so I've definitely cut some corners intentionally knowing that I would get off topic if I spent too much time building platform, too little time building content. And so that's something you've had to be consciously aware of too. I assume, like how do you balance that? What's the balance between I need to make progress cause the course is in, in flight and you're building a platform. So how do you balance that when you sit down to work? Yeah. When I sit down, I think it helps me that a lot of the content I'm building is like very invigorating, like technical work. Like the examples I'm trying to build are, are fun interactions that sometimes are like kind of math heavy and that engages my brain the same way building a platform would. And yeah, I definitely spend a lot more time building content now. I wanted to get the platform just to a point of saying, let's somebody pay for it, log in and click next, next, next, and go all the way through. And I achieved that and then have really put minimal effort back into fleshing out some pieces of the course that I would really like to, I'd love to go like design a nice splashy landing page for each module and some fun, cool icons that animate and go with it. That's what my brain wants to work on, but I don't think that's the most important part and just by the nature of the content, it sounds like you're scratching some of your brain's desires by, cause it's technical. Yeah. What are some of the, you know, like thinking about just platform features that you would love to have? What would you add to it if you could snap your fingers today? I would love to have a lot of really great interactive courses I've followed have embedded programming inside it with like little exercises because the nature of the stuff I'm teaching isn't too closely related to that. I haven't bothered to, yeah, I think I could have benefited from it in some places, but I've also tried to like keep the foundational goal. Like, you know, a lot of these people coming in here won't be people that are writing code or want to know how to write code. They may tangentially glance off the surface of like some HTML and CSS. Developing websites and stuff, or, you know, interacting with web developers, but it's not everyone though. I think exposing people to that could still be very powerful. So I would have loved to have some good tooling. If there was something I could just install that got a lot of that done where I could have a program exercise. So not to spoil it, but you should check out Sandpack. Yeah. I've started looking and yeah, I. Not to ruin your weekend, but. Yeah, yeah. That's the thing. It's like, I couldn't look too close because I knew like, oh brother, I'm going to, I'm going to spend another weekend building tool, not running. Sandpack is from the people that make CodeSandbox and it's an embedded code tool that you can kind of pop into these sorts of things and it's pretty cool. And just for anybody that was curious about that one, but it is a rabbit hole. It isn't a snap your fingers, but it is very cool. Right, right. Yeah. So what is the tech stack? How did you build this? What went into like tech, technologically speaking, what has gone into building, building your core? I would say the secret sauce was, I mean, MDX I feel like is the most important piece I can have markdown content. That's pretty easy to author where I can drop in react components I want. And write whatever react I want to drop in, which is really great. And I've been able to do some really nice, nice things that make it really easy to author great examples, thing, render things side by side, render things that can animate. And that helps me like kind of build it fast and make a lot of these examples. I feel like the other key piece that makes it, made it possible. I saw like super base early on was catching some eyes and it looked like it delivered a lot of things that I wanted, which was basically really easy authentication and gated content and a database managed for me and yeah. So that I think I got like a super base instance set up in like a couple hours and had an app I could log into. And I was like, great. That was one of the biggest pieces I needed. It's a wonderful product. Handles a lot of that for me. It is it. I've been really impressed and it started become this evangelist for it. When I see people need help on Twitter, I'm like, let me tell you, that's great. It's really good. And yeah. Are you using any sort of no code D visual kind of programming tools to run any of this? Not right now. No, I, yeah, I've considered some kind of like no Cody tools to build some like tooling for me, like maybe hooking up some like feedback gathering or, you know, potentially like managing some like of a, the customer business-y type stuff, but nothing to help like actually develop the course yet. Yeah. I think the closest I saw when I went through it and purchased the, what, maybe like gumroad, I guess, where you're going in there is for like this actual sales component that would count. It wasn't like a direct stripe integration or something. And it seemed like it would be pretty smooth. Yeah. No, take it, take hours instead of days to implement. Yeah, that's true. You could probably consider that. Yeah. The payment processing. That's another important piece. I actually spent a while waffling on that. Yeah. And you can go a lot of different directions too in varied complexity, right. When you want to start going down that road. Yeah. Yeah. I started with Stripe and ended up migrating to gumroad to allay the tax burden and just, you know, be done with it, but definitely went down some rabbit holes there and I'm hoping that I don't have to go out on them again. Well, Kyle, I got to say I'm your target audience. I've really enjoyed it. I've actually learned and spent a little bit of time with the course and learned a lot, and I really appreciate you putting it together and taking the time out to chat with me today. Thank you so much. Yeah, you bet. Thanks. Appreciate that a lot. It's been a pleasure talking with you. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hi Josh. Hey Joel. Great to hang out with you. Yeah. Same. So I'm really excited. One, I started out as a fan of your writing and the personal MBA is up there on my list of recommended books for anybody that wants to explore the business space and how to fight a hydra is really something truly special and I know it's something you're proud of and we love it around the house. It's just great. And I keep extra copies and I actually give that one out. What I wanted to start with before we dig into that and talk about courses and core systems is how do you approach a new complex subject when you set out to learn it? And I've asked this question in this series several times and you are the only person that's literally wrote an entire book that addresses the answer to this. Like I know that there's a lot to this, but how do you, what's your kind of basic framework for approaching learning something new and complex? Yeah, I just by personality and inclination, I tend to rabbit hole on things pretty hard. And the book that you mentioned, the first 20 hours is a book about how to acquire new skills, learn new things as quickly as possible. And I usually start just by, by being very specific about what it is I'm trying to do and constrain the topic as much as I can because otherwise it's easy to go off the beaten path, waste a lot of time, do way too much research, spend a lot of time like working around or learning around a topic instead of deciding exactly what it is I'm trying to do and then doing that thing as directly as possible. And yeah, I'll usually be very specific about what I'm trying to do. Just a little bit of research to learn how to think about this, learn how to approach it, find a few resources or guides or tutorials, and then jump into the practice or the implementation as, as quickly as possible. The general insight from first 20 hours is most people find the early stages of learning something new, tremendously frustrating. Adult learners hate to feel stupid. They hate to feel like I'm not doing what I want. I'm not accomplishing what I want. I can't do this. And so a lot of it is just trying to figure out like, how can you make progress as quickly as possible so you can get that positive reinforcement? Like I'm getting better, I'm getting closer to what I want. And then how can you make sure that you spend a critical mass of time and attention early to get past that frustration barrier and to get to the point where, yeah, I'm seeing this take shape, I'm seeing myself getting the results I want. That's exciting. That's motivating. And from there, it's really just like spend as much time as you need to get the result you want and then figure out, should I keep investing here or should I move on and learn something else? I think in my experience, too, like a lot of times we want some difference in our life or we want to do a specific thing and you have to learn it and then you're bad at it, like you said. And that's really frustrating because you really just want to do the thing. You don't wake up in the morning and be like, oh, I'm really excited to read a book or take a course. And some people might be. But really, it's about doing something and accomplishing something, some difference in your life that you want to achieve. And you have to go through this frustrating period of being a noob and suffering if you want to get there. Are you a course taker? Do you seek out online courses and take them when you're trying to learn something new? It really depends on the topic. Like I usually default to books, usually because it's easier to skim and scan and focus on the most relevant parts. There's a lot to be said for audio and video courses, but time is one of the big drawbacks of that. Like it's, I can think of maybe a handful of courses that I've signed up for specifically because I wanted to learn something about this specific topic. And there was a targeted course that was already made on it. I think we share an interest in audio. So Curtis Judd is a, he does audio for film, has a YouTube channel that's really good. And one piece of equipment, Sound Devices has an audio interface called the Mix Pre series. And Curtis has a course specifically about the Mix Pre 2, how to set it up, what all the controls are, how to get certain results or set it up to do certain specific things. And I remember signing up for that course. I'm like, I have a couple of things I want to do. I went into the course. I found a couple of videos that were very targeted to exactly the things I wanted. I went through it and it was great. And I tend to default for courses around, is it specific to my interest? Can I get a result from this relatively quickly? If so, awesome. There are only a few courses that, that I think really optimize for that. And I'm sad. I wish there were more like, here's how to think about X or here's how to do this very specific thing. A lot of the courses that I see almost have this implicit default assumption that this course is the only thing going on in the learner's life and you're going to drop everything and you're going to spend the next week going through these tens or hundreds of hours of audio and video stuff. And that's not realistic. That's, that doesn't fit into people's actual day-to-day life. I think it's a design problem where that difference that people are trying to achieve in their lives, where they are trying to go from A to B is miss. And it's a focus on take the course versus make that difference in your life. And they talk about completion rates and that this sort of thing is a success metric for courses. But really it's did this learner achieve what they were trying to do in their lives and that can mean completion. Or like you said, you, you bought a really great course, went in, watched the videos that were very specific to your needs, and you were successful with that course because it was able to facilitate the difference you were trying to achieve in your life. And you sound great. So I assume that it was successful. Thanks. Yeah, it was a good course. And you can see where it comes from on a marketing page for a course. It's like, we have 60 hours of instructional content, big in the sense of bigger is better, you're getting more for your money, all of that. So I don't think, I think it's something that you, you can see where it comes from, you can see how it's rewarded, but then you just end up designing courses that are really frustrating for a learner because they may not necessarily be able to get the result that they're looking for in the time that they have available. Yeah, 60 hours is a long time. And then, like you said, there, and fundamentally, this is something just observationally is that there is a ton of focus and there's a ton of resources out there for marketing and like launching courses and not a lot in terms of how do we design something that's excellent and effective for the learners to help them achieve what they're trying to do, which actually is it like, what are good qualities or what is the, what are the qualities of a good course if you're sitting down, maybe even as a learning designer or a student? Yeah, I think there are two, two general magisteria of courses with very different objectives and very different outcomes. So the first would be like the Curtis Judd example that I brought up earlier, like very specific, very targeted, very niche. Here's the thing you want to do. Here's a piece of equipment you want to use. Here's a technique you want to learn. And the whole course is focused on how to get that particular result. Yes. Very targeted. The other course, which is the type of course that I've spent a lot of time thinking about and designing and, and creating a system around is maybe call it the, how to think about fill in the blank course, it's very like the transformation or the end result is not necessarily like some straightforward, practical, you were not able to do X now you're able to do X kind of thing. It's a shift in understanding and insight and being able to see the world or relate to other people or think about how you're doing things in a completely different way. And so for me, my, my first book, the personal MBA is essentially a book about how to think about business. It's a collection of mental models. It's a way of understanding what businesses are and how they work and what makes a good business and how you can make whatever it is that you're working in or on better over time. And so that's a very different instructional design problem than the very targeted instrumental. How can you get this result as quickly as possible? And I think that the, both the content of the course, but then also the method in which it's delivered needs to be very different because things like exposure to the information over a longer period of time is terrible for an instrumental course because you're just taking too much time to deliver the end result. But for a how to think about course, that could be very beneficial. Things like spaced repetition, things like sitting with a concept and trying to apply it or ask questions about the learner's life, get them to integrate whatever it is that they're learning from an informational standpoint, like really integrate it into their experience and their knowledge, make conceptual connections, hooks between what it is you're telling them, the information that you're delivering and how they can imagine themselves acting about these things in the future or making decisions about these things in the future. Kind of approaching like their personal identity and developing a system around it. Instead of I'm going to learn to do this, it's I'm a person that does this sort of thing in their lives, like transformational change in a lot of circumstances, I would assume. And to me, it's like learning how to program computers and people focus very heavily on syntax and applying syntax and applying syntax where what is really difficult about being an expert computer programmer is not the syntax. And you learn that after a while. But until you have internalized that, it is it feels impossible because you can't think about the problems and you'll do it and you'll learn some. Totally. And you can see this division in programming books really well. So there's like the, I don't know, recipes or design patterns or algorithms book. Like, here's how you here's how to set up a Redis instance and here are the data structures you can use and here are some recipes or common patterns or things that you can crib from the stack overflow approach. How, like, how do I do this? And then you have books like principles of software design. It's like very high level. How do you think about creating a program? What's important. What's not. I was just in, this isn't video, but I'm over my shoulder. There's Newt's four part set of computer science is on my shelf right there. Which totally good. Yeah. And it's his work is fundamental, instrumental, like really changes the way that you view this entire domain as a whole and yeah, the way that book is written is completely different than a cookbook or a set of recipes to get a particular result. And so, yeah, it's, I think a lot of this, when we talk about instructional design or course design, it's really beneficial to think through what, what type of course is this for you? Because not all courses are the same. I think there's a place for both too. Absolutely. You often need a cookbook. I want step-by-step because this is the exact problem I'm trying to solve. Just show me how to solve it. We don't, I don't need to learn how to think. Just show me how to solve my problem. And that can be like, that can make the difference you'd need like long-term. It's the systematic approach that really makes the biggest change in my life personally, when I've experienced any sort of course or book or what have you. One thing I'm curious about, cause I know you don't, I don't believe you have any sort of public courses available, right? Like people can't go buy a course from you currently. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah, that's a good one, but you do instructional design and you do teach people and you do probably more in the training than what you might call a formal course at this point. Is that right? Yeah, not very well known. Personal MBA was a course before it was a book. I didn't know that at all. Yeah. So I, I had been consulting with people, coaching individual entrepreneurs for a while, and then I created a very early, this was a decade plus ago and I didn't know that course was online for a couple of years and then the book came out and I wanted to focus on the book, but it was also taped and recorded in the era before good audio and good video and lighting was easily accessible. And so at a certain point, the production, I just looked at it. I'm like, I'm embarrassed about the production value of this course. Like I need to redo it. What I'm doing now, because in the interim I learned how to program, I actually learned how to program in the process of researching the first 20 hours. And some of my frustrations about how I did the first version of the personal MBA course, now that I know how to program and I can actually control the system or control the frame in, in, in which the course is delivered, that's a superpower. Like I can do things with the course now that I couldn't do back then. And yeah, that's the core system that I'm working on. The things that I'm working on right now are really trying to do version two of the personal MBA course in a much better and more sophisticated way than version one was. I think it's interesting. And you talk about the personal MBA, which I believe is the currently the 10th anniversary edition is out there. So that was a while ago, but it, you started developing that as a course first, and I'm always flipping back in terms of design, because I feel like a lot of courses that exist or that I've worked on would have been well-suited to be designed like a book versus designed as a course first. And then I also, and you talk, and it's like workshops and what is the design process, and I'm wondering what the difference for you maybe is between if you're sitting down and thinking about a book versus sitting down and thinking about a course, is there a difference between process or how you would consider like the research and design aspect of those? I think there's a substantial level of overlap and it really depends on the book that, that you're working on. And something like a well-constructed narrative nonfiction sort of book. I, a good example of this, this style done well is Range by David Epstein. Awesome book, full of insights and is structured in the form of a story or a narrative. It's an, you are going through an intellectual experience and imaginative experience with the author. And I think the process of writing that sort of book and developing a course is very different. If anything, a lot of folks, and David included, the general approaches you write this book and then you can structure something like a speech, like a talk, like a training to abbreviate it a little bit, highlight the stories, deliver that sort of narrative experience in a shorter format, but those books. Tends to be really difficult to adapt to courses because instructional design was not part of the process. It's something that kind of has to be shoehorned in later. Telling a story versus instructional design, I think maybe is a way to think about it. Yeah, totally. And if you're focusing on the story, you don't necessarily want to like leave out a bunch of that. So that's the story is the point. And, but for me, I usually focus on writing how to think about fill in the blank books. It's not necessarily a narrative, although there will be stories and examples in it. I think about my work as creating a collection of mental models, a conceptual idea about how something works in the world, being very clear and isolating those for the reader. And so it's not necessarily narrative is here's how to think about something important. And then here are some stories and examples to help that stick in your mind a little bit better. And in terms of instructional design for the personal MBA course that I'm working on, it's structured very much at the mental model level. Here's this idea, here's an explanation of what it is and how it works. Here are some examples. And then here are some questions or exercises to help you, the learner integrate this and figure out how does this, can you think of examples of this in your own life? Can you think about examples of this in the world that you're already aware of? How might you apply this specific idea in your business or in your career or to accomplish the things that you want to do and the discrete unit of the course. And the book is entirely structured around this idea. Here's the mental model. Here's how to understand it. Here's what you do with it. Now you're creating a course and I know that you're building the course system, constructing your own course platform to produce this and deliver it to people. Why not just use something that exists? Why not go to Teachable and put it on there or one of the other perfectly fine platforms that exist for delivering a course, why not use something like that? You mean aside from, for fun? Aside from, yeah, like aside from, I guess the personally, I enjoy doing this kind of aspect, which is frankly, I think that's really important, right? If you can and want to, then I think it's a very good idea to, to do that sort of thing, but otherwise, like what's the, is it just peer control or what is it that you seek when you're designing and building a course system for yourself? Yeah, the, so there's a practical element and then there's a kind of design problem element. So the design problem element and the, what got me thinking about this in the first place is that the personal MBA, if you go to the book, there are 250, give or take, discrete concepts that are discussed in the book. And when you map that to the default instructional design of something like a Teachable course or a Udemy course or whatever, it falls into, have you ever signed up for a course and, you know, you go through the payment thing, you have your login, you log in and then it just feels like you get a bucket of stuff. It's like, welcome to the course. Here's everything. Left-hand side navigation, introduction video, right? Good luck. Yeah, totally. And with very little guidance, like you just, here you go. At a certain point, but I would say probably beyond one E give or take course modules, that design structure really breaks down, the learner logs in and they are very overwhelmed by what they see. It's too much. There's too much to process. And without some guidance or helping people navigate through the course in a more systematic way, people can just get overwhelmed and say, yeah, this is not for me, request a refund or drop off, and they never get the value or the benefit from the course. And so one of the things that, that I thought a lot about, and I'm really curious to, to see if it works in the context of personal MBA, I want to have a course instead of asking someone to, all right, set aside six hours, half a day's work to go through this thing from start to finish, I want to see if a course, how to think about business course that's delivered over a much longer period of time, how that does. And it's much more straightforward, less overwhelming for a person to receive an email. Your next course module is ready. Here's what it's about. Log in, the system automatically directs them to that particular lesson. It's maybe 10 minutes. And then they go through the lesson, they mark it complete. The system keeps track of that. And then the next day they automatically get the next lesson without having to think about it, without having to find where they are in the core system. Log, remember to log in, do all of those things. Like can you, a system that really removes the cognitive effort and the friction from someone going through this course from A to B, can you make it much smaller, less intimidating modules, just delivered over a much longer period of time, but kind of the crushing weight of the table of contents, right? Like you're staring at that and the, Oh, here's 60 hours. And it's just like your brain says, yeah, you know what? I could just Netflix right now. And I don't even have to think about this. And what's also interesting to me is because the personal MBA is not, it's linear because it's a book and it has a table of contents and you could read it back to front and it actually does read well, that's how I read it, but you don't have to, it is like something that you can go in and be like, I'm really struggling with this right now. And maybe you knew it a little bit, or you'd read the table of contents and you could jump in and get something that's pertinent to your current needs without having to go through it in a front to back sort of fashion. And that sort of thing is really fascinating to me from a course perspective too, because I think we could probably think about these things more like that than the linear progression through a very rigid outline. Yeah, totally. One of the features that I built in thinking along those lines was I call it random mode. Instead of going through the course from front to back, maybe a learner goes through the course from front to back at first, and that doesn't necessarily mean that their engagement with the course has to end. They can continue going and then the system will just give them a random concept, and there are enough of them in there for a person to be productively engaged with this course for potentially years. And as long as people are, the spaced repetition element is really important in terms of reminding people of certain things or a certain amount of serendipity is a wonderful thing to have. And then it's also a value for money thing. If you're finding spending time in this way is valuable, you could potentially do that for a much longer period of time. And that just increases the value of the course. It makes it more value. And also I think you're what you're talking about, it allows you to increase that identity and that system and your needs grow. And these lessons are something that you could learn again or have repeated or learn at a higher resolution. And one of my favorite concepts that I learned from Kathy Sierra is this idea of spiral learning, where we learn the first pass and it's low resolution and you just don't like you get, you know, you just, you see it. It's like a low resolution JPEG. You circle back, you do things in your life and you come back around and now it's like a higher resolution. You can see it and understand it. You're learning the same lesson at a different resolution and like it can come out and like at the perfect time in your life where you can now see this and use it in a different new way because you've advanced on several different fronts. And I love that concept. Yeah, that's amazing. So I love this idea of progressive review and that's something it's like you come in and you don't have the entire map laid out. It's almost like fog of war or like you jump into a video game and you can see that you're going to be able to take an adventure. And I was wondering if like if that sort of playful interaction with a course has influenced what you've built with your system. Yeah, a little bit. So I'm really just trying to in, in the design of the system, reduce cognitive load as much as I can. And the jumping around, all of that is, is possible and encouraged. Like the system keeps track of what you've seen. You're not going to see things that you have already seen unless you opt in for that or want it. I've spent a lot of time. I think the serendipity elements, you can see it with, with the cohort based courses. Yeah. You're signing up with, you're signing up for a certain amount of knowledge transfer, information transfer, but you're also signing up for the serendipitous sort of community interaction that a lot of people find valuable. I think there's a time and a place for that. And I think that's also can sometimes fall into the trap of, okay, now taking this course is your part-time job. Like assuming that people are going to spend six hours a week doing this thing. Showing up at a certain time, doing a certain activity, being responsible, having other people that are going to be there at the same time, doing the same thing, that sort of thing. And I think that there's another way of structuring courses that's a little bit more think personal individual mentorship, like a one-on-one relationship between the learner and the instructor, where there's a back and forth conversation that's happening. It's just asynchronous. So instead of hopping on zoom and having a call for an hour where the instructor is teaching the material over and over again, like you can have videos, you can have audio, you can have the instructional information transfer stuff pre-recorded and at the learner's convenience. And then depending on the exercises or the questions that you ask, if the system allows it, the instructor sees it and then can reply and there can be a back and forth that's asynchronous and extremely valuable. And to the learner, it just feels like it's them and the instructor, the person that they want to learn from instead of having this like mass group experience all the time. So I'm really trying to build the serendipity for me in the course. What is it going to be like to have a whole bunch of people going through this course and be at different parts of the system, different parts of the information thing. But there's this really interesting interaction of let's say a learner has a particular experience and shares an example around a concept as the instructor, I can take that, make it an example, update the course material. And now everybody who goes through the course after that is going to benefit from the experience of another learner going through exactly the same thing. There's something emergent and cool about that kind of progressive enhancement of the course material over time. It makes it relationship based too. And I've always said, and people, cause people will go out and I need a mentor in a certain thing. And I'm like, you can buy a book and that is a mentor relationship. That person might not even exist on this planet anymore, but you can learn from them and have that conversation. But what you're talking about is a growing system where this is an ongoing conversation that we're going to have together and your work actually matters. And when you have something interesting, we can bring that back into it and evolve the overall system for everybody, including the, like that individual. Exactly. Are you like testing? Do you, how do you test a new course system? Is this something that like you invite people to or that you just work on until the big reveal happens and you to die on folks or what's your kind of approach to like testing course material? It's the material or the system itself? The system and the material. I don't know. I don't know how to separate them in a lot of ways, but yeah, the system itself. Sure. I've had various incarnations of my system running in, in beta with other courses for.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"a while and also going back to your question about like why build one instead of, I think version one of the personal MBA course was on Word, WordPress with a bunch of plugins and whatever, and it broke all the time because WordPress is updating and the plugins are updating and the external third-party systems are updating and at some point somebody is going to update something that breaks things and when it breaks, it's not their responsibility, it's your responsibility to fix. Everybody gets mad at them. They get mad at you. That is when I made a holy vow that I would never use WordPress for anything ever again, if I could avoid it. And one of the great joys that worked far beyond my initial expectations in doing the beta version of this system is that I've had software running courses in production for I think six years now, and they are rock solid stable because nothing changes unless I change it. You have to do security updates, you have to a minimum amount of maintenance, but it's possible to develop a core system that is feature complete for exactly what you want to use it for. And if it's complete and there's no, no major glaring security vulnerability that you need to patch right away, like it just sits there and runs and you have to spend a lot less time and energy thinking about it and maintaining it than an external third-party system. So I'm completely out of your control at that point. Like you're able to gain the control and stability because it's something you designed and can at every level fix or update or do what you need to do with your system. And you already know how it works. And so if you need to change something or add something or delete something, like that's a much more straightforward problem that of a WordPress installation to try to duct tape and superglue something in or out. And the downside of owning your own system versus a third party system is it doesn't improve unless you spend the time and energy and attention to make it do something. And so at least for me, I want to have enough control over the system that I can control the process and what the learner sees and what the whole experience feels like from start to finish. And that's not going to change dramatically over time. Like I have a set of things that it really needs to do if it does those things and the uptime is great and learners are happy, like problem solved. Can you briefly, and this'll take us out here, I would like a brief technical explanation of the stack, what has gone into your core system? Like how does it run and how did you build it? Sure. So I learned Ruby in the process of researching first 20 hours. I love it. It is a joy to program in and I do not use the vast majority of Rails. I use Sinatra and I love Sinatra because it's lightweight. There's no auto magical generator code things that are putting code in my code base that I didn't put there myself. And Ruby and Sinatra is the base. I use Redis as my primary database and single store of truth version. I'm now in version three of my course system. Version two was on Postgres. And I found that at least for my, for my uses, it was way overkill. It was very complicated. Schema migrations were a pain in the butt. It was, there was a very long cycle time, like between me having an idea, implementing it and going through all of the Postgres schema stuff in order to make that happen. So with what I found is with core system, like you're dealing with really simple information. So a key value store is amazing. This is data types are perfect for this sort of thing. And if you want to store strings and lists and arrays and sets and all of that good stuff, like Redis already has it. And because it's text, it's relatively small. And, and over time, Redis's persistence and availability and backup capabilities become really great. And the, the benefit is the development time is very straightforward. Like you just keep notes on how you're still, I just, I essentially have a text document that's a schema file. It's a reference document for myself of like where I'm storing things, what the keys look like. But from there, you're dealing with very small amounts of information. And so when it's in memory in Redis, the whole site is just blazing fast. And it's definitely a not so traditional stack. Most people still consider using Redis as a primary store of value to be on the risky unorthodox side. For me, it's been amazing. Some of the fun things that that has allowed me to do is I have a version of the core system that is optimized for group training experiences. And say, for example, I'm doing training for a corporation and there are 25 learners going through the course at the same time. With Redis, I can do something that would otherwise really bog down a system. Like for example, I can put a on, on keystroke JavaScript thing in a comment field and every time somebody adds a character to their notes, it's throwing it up to Redis. And what that allows me to do on the backend as the instructor is I can have a module page and refresh it. And I can see what all of the learners are taking in their notes fields as it's happening. And if I shift from instructional delivery into something like a live conversation, I already have all their notes. Like I can read those in advance. I can call on people and say, Hey, you had a really good example about this. Would you like to jump in and explain this for the group? Like I had one, one of my clients is that's pretty close to mind reading. It is really cool. And because the overhead of Redis, because it's so fast, I can have thousands of requests per second over a relatively small user base. And Redis can handle it fine. And those sorts of things like understanding where the technology is and what cool things does this unlock that something like a teachable, like just would completely break and fall down trying to do that's really fun. And really cool. It's a great space. Like you have an infinite space to explore and try new things, help people succeed. Yeah. And then architecture, architecture wise, I just use a very minimal amount of JavaScript. I know enough to be dangerous, but I don't know enough to do like all of the fancy front end react sort of things. I know a lot to be dangerous. Yes, you do. I can be dangerous with JavaScript all day. Josh, I think we could geek out on this for hours and I look forward to in the future. I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. Thank you so much. And I look forward to seeing the personal MBA and I will be signing up on day one. Awesome. Thanks so much. It was a pleasure to be here. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm pretty excited to talk to you today because I think we both have a strong mutual passion for teaching people and helping people and, you know, like elevating others through our experience. And we do that through, you know, like online teaching and writing articles and all that fun stuff. I want to kind of kick it off and ask you, when you sit down to learn something, like what's your personal learning style, like how do you think about new difficult problems or subjects or areas of knowledge that you want to dive into and go about learning? Yeah, that's a great question. You know, it might surprise people because of video courses, but I do a lot of reading and I do, you know, not just a lot of reading, but I have folders and folders on my machine full of like really silly little things. For example, I'm learning Rust right now and I already have a dozen tiny, super tiny, like little Rust apps that are for me to learn. Or, you know, I spin up code sandboxes left and right. I spin up JS bins still, because sometimes it's just the fastest way to do some JavaScript, you know? So yeah, that's me. I read a lot and then I try little things. I really encourage people, just try it. Like you don't know how some expression or syntax or something works, try it and find out. There's no harm in it. Let it break a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting to me and I don't know if you've kind of noticed this, but I hear it a lot and people obviously love video learning, but I am just in having these conversations with people that create courses, there's kind of a strong opinion that text and written content is maybe a preference. And I'm wondering, have you noticed that in terms of people consuming your own content or just generally, or do you think, you know, what's the balance of those two kind of modes of learning? I kind of feel like both should augment each other. For example, you know, I watch a lot of stuff that isn't tech. Like I watched a lot of woodworking videos and let me tell you, I'd much rather watch them than sit down and read it. So to some degree it's, what are you learning? But also there's other things. When I'm reading tech, because so much of it has to be like code samples, I do at least want to see them in a place that is like static. So I can look at this, I can study it, maybe I can play with it. I really feel like they can benefit each other. When I write blog posts, you know, I can dive into things in written words sometimes that are more difficult to explain with a video, or, you know, it might just be boring. Like I am talking to you in a video, you'd rather just read that at your speed versus I'm showing you in a video. You know, egghead's all about show, you know, don't talk at the user, you know, keep showing them what you're doing. So I just kind of feel like, you know, really good content probably has a mix of both. And honestly, me moving forward, everything I'm trying to do is both. And I'm not trying to do a one-to-one thing. The thing I write isn't just a transcript. It's like, the thing I write is the written way I would explain this concept. The video I make is the visual way I would explain this concept. It's a different medium. It's not just like taking a transcript from a video doesn't replace the like writing the article or the lesson in a written format. Yeah, I agree with that for sure. When did you like, you've been doing this for a while now. Is making courses and teaching and taking that from kind of more of an ad hoc, almost hobby level of instructing into making more refined courses, has that had any impact on your life or career? Yeah. You know, when you go to make content, it's okay maybe not to know everything, but in the process of making it, you're going to learn so much about the topic you're trying to share. You thought you knew it, you don't know it, like until you try and teach it, even then you don't know it. Teaching refines understanding. It's worthwhile to pursue trying to even just share information because you'll gain a more solid understanding. I think other things are like, let's be honest, it's made my network a wonderful network. I've gotten to meet really cool people. I've gotten to know a lot more people and just the idea that people reach out to me every once in a while and they're like, dude, I took this, you know, honestly, I think my linked list lesson, that one lesson I think has made half the money just because so many people have to learn how to do a linked list for dumb interview, you know? And so, you know, not to thank a poor interview question for my success, but to some degree I get so many people reach out and be like, I didn't know shit about this until I took this course. I didn't know shit about it until I made the course. So you're welcome, bro. I've had to implement a linked list on the job once and for like a purpose, it was the perfect data structure for, which made me pretty happy actually to like actually need something like that in a practical sense, like I'm graphing it out and I'm like, wait, this is a linked list. There you go. I've only used it once too. So it's like synthesizing it from scratch a little bit, but then, you know, the pattern forms and you all of a sudden you're using something that you know. If I can go on this a little bit, that's the thing that drives me. I really like to think about patterns. I like to think about underlying concepts. And so when I'm trying to teach something, I want the people who are learning from me to be able to walk away with like, maybe it's a linked list is the implementation, but the idea is like this node connects to this node connects to this node. And if I ever have something in my work life where that's happening, I recognize the pattern and then apply the data. Like I don't want them to just go off with, I happen to know X, Y, Z about this thing. I would assume. And it's funny because you talked about woodworking and I've done a little bit of that and learned and kind of did it through the visual demonstration way and seeing plans and even taking classes. And to me, like it's just this idea of anything that we want to know. It's the idea of a pattern, spotting the pattern and seeing it in one context and learning it, but then being able to take that pattern and apply it in new context. And that's really the trick, right? When you were able to take it from following instructions, step-by-step into, you know, like something where you build it on your own or solve a problem on the job where the variables are different, but you're like, wait, this is the same pattern. And you're able to apply that. And I've never been able to achieve that with woodworking, but I definitely have been able to achieve it in my coding life and see it over and over again. It's probably true for gosh, almost, almost most things at the end of the day, when you're really trying to learn like complex subjects, right? Like that's the, that's where it's at. I totally agree. That's exactly what I'm trying to get at. I don't really enjoy making content that I call like duct tape content and it's perfectly fine. It needs to be out there, especially in the dev rel space. And by that, let's build X app by duct taping W Y Z or whatever, these three things together. And I don't enjoy making that content as much because to me, those variables are interchangeable. I'd much rather talk about how did we put these together? What was the patterns we used to do this? So then, you know, tomorrow, if you want to refactor something to use, say, let's say it's a react app and you're using one state management, truthfully, like if you follow good patterns, you can probably replace the whole thing with something else. And I'd rather you have the confidence to be able to do that, to be able to follow the pattern, not just what were the docs that this library had me stitched together and stuff like that. I think it's been a pretty strong preference just in the world is like sorting by new means the best things are going to be at the top when you're like the newest thing is the current best thing. And just my practical experience is that isn't always the case, right? Like you can, if you go back to thought or philosophy or computer science or anything, there's this, these patterns that people have discovered over the years. And you know, if you're ignoring those or we're constantly renaming those, it makes it really a struggle for learners because it's vocabulary is already a struggle. Now you're dealing with this, you know, like renaming for, for all sorts of various purposes. Some of them commercial, some of them, you know, just mistakes, right? Like we just rediscover things. Yeah. I agree. I agree. That kind of relates to, I was wondering, how do you decide what to teach? Like when you're, you know, like you're sitting down and you're like, I'm going to make a course. Is it like the something, is it like a Eureka moment or is that something that's intentionally, you know, do you seek out what to teach? You know, I, gosh, I'm probably not the best at this. I think there are people who are more pragmatic and, and more rigorous in coming up with, a lot of it is just like what intrigues me enough to put in the time because making courses takes me quite a bit more time than I think people expect. It's work. Yeah. And I don't think that, I don't think it's just, Oh, a video editing takes a lot. It's even my process is just long. If you don't mind, I'll explain a little bit. Yeah. Let me hear it. So my state machine course for egghead is a really great example. I made a course that has, I don't know, 20 something lessons and I did a workshop and we had probably, I think it was four or five weeks to do it because we were getting it done for the holiday. If I remember the holiday promo and I shit you not, man, I probably put 200 hours into it. Like I was getting up early, I was going to bed late. And the reason I put in so much is because the way I build up my knowledge base for something like that is I literally rewrote the docs, like in my own notes, basically, like I just kept reading them and rewriting them. And I was like, Oh, in fact, I made six contributions to the docs because I ended up finding, Oh, this doesn't match up. This doesn't make sense. But I needed to build up that knowledge base to feel confident about something I was already interested in, but like I thought I knew, but I didn't, you know, to some degree. And so half the time was that. And then the other half is just, you know, with my ADHD, sometimes I really, I just don't make great incremental progress. So things take me a lot of time. And so having that interest in something, it's a really big deal for me. If I'm not interested, even though it's practical, like I'll never do it. Like I just won't get it done. And so I think that's why my courses have looked quite a bit different than other people's courses. You know, I think, I think to me, it really is interest driven. You mentioned that you did work, the workshop and approached it that way. Is that something you're typically going to think about? Or I know that at the time, like, I think we were asking people to do that sort of thing, but just what is your, you know, outside of that, if you're going to sit down and you're thinking about the reduced course or async await and just asynchronous JavaScript in general, what are you doing to design and prepare for that kind of the asynchronous way? Right. Cause that's an idea in your head. So you're obviously thinking about it and you know, like you're in the stream of thought, but you know, like what other kinds of processes do you employ? That's great. That's a great question. Cause cause I don't think people realize some of these ideas sit in my head for like years and they're just like churning. But in terms of actual like work that's documented progress, I've been starting to write obsidian notebooks or, or whatever you would call them about the topics. I have this idea and I don't, I feel I've been sharing this in private, but I might try this. I'm not sure it's worth it, but I'm thinking about releasing or selling my obsidian notebooks on a topic as like additional material or as part of the material. I have this belief that there's value in learning graphically, not just linearly, but it's unproven to some degree, or at least I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time. You mean like a network graph, like a neural, not a neural network that's probably overloaded, versus a straight line where like a book is a straight line and the entire curriculum for your college degree is a graph. Yeah. I just have this feeling like if I were to hand someone a graph, a second brain of my react knowledge, I could make a linear path through it and I will, but I would love the idea of having, being able to connect to all the concepts and then giving you the opportunity to just have access and to explore. Because I think part of learning is exploring, like you really want to solidify a concept. You can't just go watch my video or take some exercise. You have to explore this or that. Try building this or that. It doesn't have to be big. It just has to be big enough to connect the nodes of ideas in your brain. And I'm writing those to some degree. Those are sporadic. I'm not the best note taker. I never have been. So it's a bit of a pipe dream, but it's something I'm thinking about doing. But then I'll start to write some articles. I'll start to, I have a whiteboard up here. I'll start to break down what are ideas I want to hit. And frankly, like half my ideas probably don't make it. You know, it's just, I have never been afraid to just have an idea, have it, explore it. Maybe it goes nowhere. And yeah, I just kind of sit there and there just comes this inflection point for better or worse where it's okay. I feel comfortable enough to know the direction I'm going, where I'm starting. Maybe I write a script or two and I just, you know, get started. Once I get moving, once I get some videos recorded or a blog post written on it or whatever, then I can really sit down and start to break down the tasks. And I'll do like the state machine course. For example, I had a Trello board because it's nothing special. It was just a few columns, but it was like, here's all the videos I got to do. Here's all the writing I got to do. Knock them out. But in a nicer format, I think Trello boards like Kanban and Swimlanes in general are just a useful way to visualize, right? Get some of that dopamine of knocking it off, you know? I think one of the interesting things, and I actually like fully agree with you on this idea that we are working in nodes on a graph and then the connections, like why is this connected? Like the edges between the nodes is really like a often overlooked bit of metadata. Why should I go over here? And you're absolutely right. You can carve a path through it and you can carve a straight line through a graph and we have to do that at some point. You have to, you know, even just connecting two nodes is making a line, right? So now you have that. Why are these connected? Why are you moving on to this? And why is this the next step? It's really an interesting concept to me. And then also this ability to, you know, for everybody's circumstance, they might want to like veer over here and it's like completing a course isn't the goal for most people. I don't think many people sit down and wake up in the morning and think, you know what? I'm going to take a course today and I'm going to get finished. We can sit down and kind of think about general ideas that, you know, people probably want to get a nice six figure job as a web developer and, you know, more of that, please. But, you know, what else is going on in their lives or what goals are they trying to achieve is always an interesting challenge of navigating people through the graph because everybody wants a trail to like that's important. But how do you balance that prescriptive with the freedom of choice that we're all presented with on the internet? It's true. And I think that might be informed by where you are in your career and like how you learn or what you want to learn. Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting. Yeah. So typically a course is going to have examples where you're demonstrating something and then exercises and I was wondering, how do you design examples for your lesson? Like when you want to sit down and be like, what should I like demonstrate to build? Because that's part of that choice we're making, right? That's part of that structure and it's kind of important. And you almost never get it right and right's maybe not the right word. I just, man, I've said this on Twitter, I probably shouldn't say here, but you're never going to make everyone happy with your examples. If you do, like you're probably making something so watered down that it's not useful to be honest. But even then they'll complain because it isn't useful. Some people are very good at it. I honestly feel like my examples are weak, but that could be more like I view myself that way, not how the world views me. And I'm willing to admit that, but it depends on the thing. For example, this Reduce course, I made examples the exact way I decided to really learn Reduce. I decided one day as a joke to sit down and redo all the array methods with just Reduce. And I got through 20 of them. There's a boatload of them. I got through a lot of them. And I, so those examples to me, that's how I did it. That just was just, that's how I learned. So you get to, you know how I learned to ride a bike, you learn to ride a bike. But other ones like, so my State Machines course, this was kind of fun. I didn't want to do it UI focused. Someone else was already making at the time a State Machine and React course during that same window of time, if you remember. And I just looked around my house and I looked for things that are State Machines, like a light switch. I'm pointing to one in my room right now for those listening. Or the Space Heater, literally I did three or four lessons. I think there was some, if I remember right, there were about like parallel machines and maybe hierarchical machines and stuff. And my Space Heater literally has both of those. And I just took things in my life and put them in there. And then other ones are like, I'm working on some material for a potential React course. I don't want to promise anything, nothing's promised. But you know, I think it's okay to just make the simple thing. I'm making a note taking app. Why? Because it covers all the concepts. Like I don't, it doesn't need to be esoteric to be useful. Well, and domain is, I'm actually a huge fan of the to-do list when it comes to web development, just because you don't have to explain it to anybody. Everybody knows what a to-do list is and sure, we're sick of that example. But also most apps that I've built at some point devolved out into just being a to-do list anyway. Or, you know, it's like CRUD, forms and lists, forms and lists, and that's so much of development. And that's not necessarily the most interesting side of development, but it's like a very practical and, you know, often true element of what the actual job is. Exactly. I think I'm with you. The whole point of the to-do list isn't to do an interesting to-do list. It's to make something so mundane that you actually can observe and see what's neat about, say this framework or this language or this statement. Like the whole point is that the details are mundane, right? Don't complain about the example because that's not the real point of what you're doing. The real point is to give you exposure to whatever this new concept or topic is through the lens of something familiar. So when somebody's coming, how do you, when you're thinking about and designing a course or putting together your course material, how do you balance this need for prerequisite knowledge and the assumptions of what they'll actually know coming into the experience? Sure. I probably side a little too far on the I'll give you all the foundation kind of stuff. It's not, it's not, I taught people JavaScript to do any of my courses. That happens to be the language I know best and write in, but there are things where I'll take a moment and explain what is just a language feature. But I feel like sometimes it's just worthwhile to beat and be like, okay, hey, let me break this down for you. Or, you know, I did a workshop on hooks and you know, I take a beat to be like, this is a closure just so we're all on the same page before we go forward. The hardest part about doing that is you'll always run into people who are like, I know that Kyle. I'm like, good for you. There are some people who don't. Can you stay calm for two minutes while I finish? You know, you know, there's always people like that. The truth is when you teach, you just have to accept the fact that you won't meet everyone at the exact right place. So in my case, I probably lean a little more towards explaining concepts. Maybe I don't have to to most people, but I'd rather do it to be safe than to leave people confused later on down the road. Yeah, that makes sense. When you set out and you've built a course delivery platform to present your courses on, what was your approach for building that? What were the options available to you? And ultimately, what did you decide in terms of kind of broad strokes? Not necessarily. Not details. Yeah. Like, you know, like we're this isn't a we're not chatting about the programming details, but I'm curious about the like the thought process and that went into the actual construction of it. Sure. Because we have so many options, really. Yeah. I want to I want to speak about it from a like a philosophical point. Sure. Really quick. I do not feel naturally inclined to be a good like entrepreneur to build businesses. It's not really where my interests are, what I think about. But I recognized having that it's almost a superpower. Having that ability could be useful in my life. And so building a platform for myself was partly a way to experiment and pursuing building a business and being an entrepreneur in a low risk way. At the end of the day, my courses aren't going to get me sued like I'm not writing stuff that's going to cause security issues or something someday. And so this is a low risk way for me to practice being an entrepreneur, to see, one, can I do it? What lessons can I learn? So to me, just building the platform was a lesson in that. So the way I chose to go about it was as I do with most things. I started with a tweet as stupid as that sounds, but I made a tweet of, you know, I saw some people who needed to learn Reduce. I had this crazy idea that I would just take my blog, which really informed why and how I want to write courses. So my blog is a Gatsby blog with MDX. It just happens to be Gatsby, you know, I don't care if it was on Next or it could be on something else. But MDX is the thing that I really like. It works best for me. I love writing in Markdown and I love being able to create little components, little things I can throw in the middle of like a blog post with React because I know React well, it makes me fast and comfortable. And I think that's the key to making anything like, you know, is you don't want to spend all day like reading docs to try and make this thing if you're trying to get stuff out quickly. And so just to back it a little bit, MDX is Markdown with JSX, meaning you can import React components into your Markdown and then they render and you get interactive interactivity versus how you might have used to do it via an iframe or some other JQuery mechanism to like inject some other piece into it. You get this like native ability to put React components in Markdown, which is. Yes, yes, absolutely. Thank you for clarifying that for the listeners. I really appreciate that. Yeah, that technology has been really useful for me. My blog has been in MDX for years. I've always wanted to be able to take my lessons to the next level, which I think meant marrying what we talked about earlier about video and written content and not making it just like one to one transcriptions. Like MDX was a simple way forward for me to be able to author things in a way I'm very comfortable and fast with while still having the option to create interesting things. For example, maybe making a quiz or making an interactive component that teaches people a little thing or, you know, excuse me, giving them a chance to see a diagram that I was able to make with something. I don't know. That wasn't just an image. Something to interact with. What was the biggest surprise then that you didn't think about and kind of ran into that might have been a technical hurdle? Honestly, to some degree for me, it was the first time interacting with Stripe. So I had to make a choice. Do I do this with client side sessions or do I do this with server sessions? I, you know, to some degree, I think even Stripe people who reached out to me said I chose wrong, but I wanted to make it as simple as possible and I did the client side stuff, but it does have limitations. So you had to make choices. Other things would be like, you know, I tweeted about this. I said, I didn't realize some serverless functions, you really need to make idempotent. But the idea that like, if this accidentally gets hit a few times with the same information, please don't make multiple purchases or please don't give them seven licenses, you know, whatever it was. So I actually learned that one the hard way. Luckily, the way I had it structured, like it just showed up as the course showing up several times in their course list of what they'd bought. Like it wasn't like they had extra licenses to give to their friends. You weren't billing them over and over again. No. With a runaway serverless function. I've had more than a couple of runaway serverless functions in my time, so I understand. You have to learn quickly and hard. How is building a course platform, building and designing a course platform different than the content production? Because it feels like they're two totally different skill sets to me. But, you know, I think it's interesting to think about the platform as well as.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"the delivery mechanism for the, you know, course content that you're creating. And it's important. I think it is important how it is delivered, but how, what's the, you know, like, how do you, how are they different in your mind? They are totally different. To be honest, I don't necessarily recommend people go build a platform. For me, it was an experiment in learning how to build like business functioning, like building a business. You really want to get in there and do it from scratch. Like not, that was that you were, you had an itch and it's not that you couldn't pick something off the shelf even you wanted to get in there and do it at a low level. And even if like your thing is you want to focus on being a teacher, right? Like not, you know, teachers maybe shouldn't have to do all the other stuff. And I think that's where a place like egghead really makes a lot of sense for people who want to be educators, but don't want to learn marketing, for example, or something like that. I think the big difference is like, you really need to think like a product person when you're building a platform. Like you need to think in terms of, okay, what features can I build out that will maybe differentiate what features do I have to have? Because everyone's just going to expect them. What things can I get away with not having at launch? What things can I add later? Like you really become a product manager of your own, your own thing. You know, like you can't just sit there all day and be like, I'm just adding this you, you really need to be decisive and judicious about what you're building. Okay. What can I add that fits whatever Kyle Shevlin offers to people? And I don't know if that makes any sense, but it does to me. It's like, you don't go out to try and be like everyone else, like you recognize competition or you, I don't even want to really call it that, but you know, you recognize where people in the space specialize and you have to ask yourself, what do I add? How can I amplify that? How can I reach people with what I add? It's funny when you describe this and I asked the question is what are the differences? And you talk about it like a product and what should I add and how do I build this? And it needs to represent my voice. And it's funny to me because I think the better question maybe was what, how are these experiences of building and designing a platform the same as building and designing a course? Because frankly, what you described to me is very similar to what we've described as like the course construction process, right? Like where the course is the product and then the platform is the product and you have these two different things and those, there's a lot of, maybe there's a lot of overlap in there even, which is just kind of a different way to flip it on its head and you almost get the same answer. But you know, like they are very different, like they're different products, like a platform is different from a course, but at the same time they are both like this thing that needs to serve the needs of the users and the person that's, you know, like creating and all these kinds of kind of multifaceted aspects of building a marketplace and then the products that sit on the marketplace. Yeah, I agree. I see that. And I didn't intentionally do that, but I agree because you know, you make a course, you have to consider who is consuming the course or, and stuff like that. So there's, there are these like meta level decisions that you make either implicitly or explicitly when you're designing it. That's not really that different from doing product design. So. How do you know when it's good enough to ship? Do I know? At some point you gotta launch it, right? Like it has to go out into the world. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I'm not going to bullshit anyone with, you know, if you're feeling comfy, it's too late. You know, I don't know any of that crap. I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to build anything that gets into YC someday. For me, it was just, do I feel comfortable with what I have done for the price I'm going to offer it, you know, to people, but to me, it was just like, okay, I've written all the posts I've made as many videos as I feel are necessary. There's a few more I could maybe make, but these are the necessary ones. They're done. People can go through the workflow and they can buy shit. There's no other bells and whistles other than the discord invite launch. Let's go. The only smarter thing I could have maybe done other than I sent out an email to my email newsletter list, but maybe I could have hyped them up for some time, like actually had a planned date and do a launch and, you know, optimize for money. But for me, it was optimizing for, I finished something. People who maybe don't have ADHD, maybe don't understand, but like 90, 95% of the things I start don't get done. Like I have a music folder sitting here with 500 half written, half finished songs, you know? Um, so to me, I have to optimize for, if I like, I have to optimize for just finish. It don't matter. So to me, once I felt like they could go through the workflow, do everything is, is just hit publish. Let's go. Did you do any testing? Like were you with learners or any other way before you launched it? No, I did reach out to a few people. I guess maybe I did. I didn't do it intentionally. It wasn't like. It wasn't a strategy. Yeah. I reached out to a couple of friends, a few that I knew who had struggled with reduce in the past. Cause that was the only course I had done for the platform. And I said, Hey, can you watch a couple of these lessons and tell me what you think? And I got good feedback back. Truth is I probably need to gain some more people who will give me critical feedback. You know, that's a challenge really. Yeah. But you know, they seem positive about it. And to be frank, I was banking on the success I had prior, like success I've had with egghead success I've had with my blog. I'm like, I feel I maybe haven't codified it. I feel like I have some sense of like when I've made a good lesson or a not so good lesson. And you know, I just trusted my gut a little bit and enrolled with it. What kind of changes do you think you'll make for the next course that you really say, do you have like platform changes or things that you'd like to see improved? Either with the course design process or the platform itself. The next one I want to do, I have ideas of which one will end up, but I'll just say things I'm going to add are actual like licenses. So companies can buy an X amount of licenses and distribute them to their, to their employees. That just seems like an obvious way to increase revenue and to increase distribution. So I have to build out that feature or find someone who's built it. I'm sure someone has, but I'll probably build it from scratch cause that's what I'm doing to learn. Other things I'm going to add are, I would like to add little maybe like quizzes or checks throughout the course of have you learned this thing? One thing I'm going to do is the, the courses will do more like hyperlinking between the lessons just so, cause as concepts overlap, like one of the things that was tough about state machines is you really needed to know four or five concepts all at once to do one lesson. And there wasn't an easy linear path. So just making it more networked within the lessons, cause I think it's just so easy to have an autoplay feature or something and just go. Yeah. Build out that graph basically. Right. Yeah. And then on top of it, I'm toying with the idea. I haven't flushed it out, but I'm toying with the idea of a little choose your adventure kind of stuff. If I'm teaching react, we get to a point like, how do I style react apps? Well, there's a bunch of choices. They're all good. They all have trade-offs. Like, and so like maybe at this point, like for styling, for example, you could try for Kate, I don't even know if that's a word between CSS modules, CSS and JS and Tailwind, you know, and like maybe the course has one linear path with just here's a two lesson tangent down this other path that you can kind of do. I imagine whatever my current like table of contents is just a list. I imagine that'll get some changes in the future. Yeah. That makes sense. Kyle, I really appreciate it. And I really think that it's great to watch. And I like always appreciate when people go out there and have that, that just Jones and desire to build from scratch. Like it's just impressive because it's, you know, there's a lot of choice out there and we can just go pull stuff off the rack, but to see people like honestly go out and build something for themselves is inspiring to me and I love to see it. And I love to see your enthusiasm, teaching people and kind of sharing what you know, and helping developers and all that fun stuff. It's been a great experience on my end, just to watch you grow and put this stuff out into the world. So thank you very much for doing that and taking the time to chat with me. Absolutely. Thank you for, thank you for all the ways you've helped me in doing this too. I appreciate it deeply and thank you for this chance to share my thoughts and have this chat too. Absolutely. My pleasure. Thanks Kyle. Thanks Joel.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hi, Angie. Hey, Joe. How's it going? It's going really well. I'm excited to talk to you again. I know we've chatted in the past and done a podcast episode, but a lot has changed in the meantime. You've done a lot of new things. I'm up to new things, and I thought we could come together and kind of talk about that. And mostly I'm interested in talking about courses and learning platforms and that sort of thing. Yeah. And you built something really nice with testing automation, you. But first I wanted to kind of break the ice a little bit. And I was wondering, when you sit down and you are personally learning something new and you have a new space that's open and you're going to sit down and learn something complex, what's your approach and how do you like to learn new things? Yeah, I really like when I'm given examples, you know, concrete information. And you would be surprised, well, maybe not you, but some people may be surprised just how rare that is. So when I'm researching new topics and things like that, there's a lot of kind of information and everyone tries to sound really smart. And it comes off like very academic versus, you know, practical. So what I do is, one, is try to find like someone that I can learn from, someone I can vibe with. And sometimes I have to go through a couple of courses before I find that. Just recently in something I'm learning, I can't really find one person that I vibe with. So I'm learning from a couple of different people and then trying to put it together so that I understand better. Yeah. And I don't know if you've experienced this and you kind of touched on it where the examples are rare or it feels like it's academic. I feel like a lot of times people are actually teaching theory to something that they've done in real life, which there's a huge difference, right? Theory is fine, but it's a big difference to me. I know. And then everyone kind of repeats what they learned from the other person. So like last night, I was looking for this definition of this concept in Java. And every resource I found gave like the exact same sentence as that definition. And none of it told me the, what is this used for and, you know, why would I want to use it? It was just like, oh, this is an interface that does X, Y, and Z. Why do you think that happens? What causes that and causes people to teach and just kind of recycle material? That's a really good question. And I think maybe not putting themselves in the learner's shoes, right? And so if I look up, well, how do I best describe this concept? And there's five or six authors who have all described it exactly the same. Then it's natural to say, okay, well, that is right, right? This has been confirmed by five or six experts. So I'll just say the same thing. And I actually need to teach that concept. So this is a really good example. I refuse to teach it that same way, Joel. So I'm trying to figure out right now, like how best, I'm basically in the learner's seat right now. Like I understand this in my head, but trying to communicate the concept out is going to be kind of challenging. So I'm trying to put myself in, okay, what if I knew nothing about this? What I would most want to know is not what it is, but why I want it. What problem does it solve? And then you can tell me like the academic little tidbits about it. But for right now, I just need to know the why. I think that you touched on something that's extremely important too, is that what is the problem being solved here? Why even bother doing this? And what am I going to be able to do when I get done is like a critical aspect that seems to get missed a lot. I know because in these tech courses, essentially what we're giving people are tools, right? And so you can teach me about a hammer, but if you don't tell me when am I supposed to use the hammer, then what good is that, right? Maybe I start using it all the time for everything or, you know, so I think that's more important than the what is the when and, you know, then I know, okay, here are all of my tools and I know what problems each one of them solve. So I know which one to grab when I face a certain problem. When you sit down and, you know, as an, and you say, you know, like you're trying to capture that beginner's mind, is your research process different when you're designing learning material than when you're learning something yourself or is there some overlap there? That's a good question. It might be a little bit different. Maybe, maybe there's some overlap, but a little bit of difference, right? I have a lot of foundational knowledge and so I can draw on that a bit. And so I try not to assume that my audience will have that same sort of knowledge, right? So I've been in tech for almost 20 years at this point. I might can skip ahead a little bit or just give me the, you know, the TDLR of this thing versus when I'm teaching, I try to go a little bit more into detail. Where do you draw the line in terms of the assumptions? Because there's, you know, like we, how many times are we going to like explain what an array is though somebody is going to need that and they might need to remediate and understand that. Like how far do you go back? What are the assumptions you're making when you're trying to teach? Yeah, that's a good question. I think it depends on the topic. So if I'm talking about something like maybe loops, for example, maybe that's not a good example. I was going to say, well, then I can make an assumption that you've already learned arrays or something like that. But you get what I'm saying. If I'm, if I'm teaching something that's applicable to another concept, I might just do a one liner kind of refresh your memory sort of thing, but not go into detail about it. When you're doing this, and I can't agree more that the examples are one of the most important things, like something that I can get into, I can dig in and feels pretty real. How do you think about those exercises when you're creating a course? Yeah, that's the best part of my courses, I think, is that I give realistic examples. So there's no full bar in my courses. I try my very best not to just, you know, give generic tails and variables, but I say let's solve a problem. And I take quite a bit of time trying to figure out good fun problems to solve that will really demonstrate the topics that I'm teaching. I draw from everything, like I'm notorious for putting like a little small game in my courses, you know, so let's build this game or whatever. And it could be like really simple, it could be a number guessing game or a dice game or card game, you know, something simple that won't take too long. But it's fun, it's something you can get behind, you understand it from a practical standpoint and now you just need to apply the code to it, you know? Yeah. How important is fun in learning? I think this is something that we debate and even the definition of fun can be kind of fuzzy, but like how important is it to have fun while you're learning or teaching? Yeah, I think it's extremely important because we're all so busy and it's very rare for someone to sit down in one sitting and take your course, right? They have to be motivated to come back. And if it's dry and boring and, you know, the examples don't resonate, then they're not going to come back, right? Unless they just absolutely need it, but they're suffering through. Even if they absolutely need it, they might go find someone else to get it from, that's a little bit more exciting. So I definitely try to add fun, I add little jokes in my course. Like I said, the projects are really fun, so let's build a game. I have one, let's build a lottery ticket generator and, you know, when you play the lottery and you win, don't forget about teacher Angie, you know? But I've actually had someone, you know, generate their numbers and they won a couple of bucks on a scratch off or something, not a scratch off, but a lotto ticket. Yeah, I think that it's really important that you make it engaging, just like anything else. If you're doing some sort of presentation or talk, you know, you want to be engaging. Same goes for a course. I also think that the other side of that is that there's this disconnect in training and like the real life processes of developing software in the enterprise. And I'm wondering, is there a way to bring those two together and still maintain that fun but deliberate, or is that just kind of covered by the example space and people are able to transfer that over? You know, I feel like that's a major gap, project based stuff in general. So a lot of the courses I see are very academic and they give you like bullet points of the information. Here's a topic. Here's the rules about that specific concept. Like the algorithm. Yeah. And then here's a very generic example. It's not specific to a real problem. I just want to show you, you know, the syntax of something, right? And what we're finding, and I truly believe this is why it's so difficult for a lot of people who are trying to enter into the tech space to find their first job. And you know, they've done all we've told them. They've taken the course. We gave them a list. Here's what you need to know. They did all of that. They haven't built anything. They don't know how to apply what they've learned to real enterprise type problems. You know, I really encourage instructors to add, you know, little projects to their courses. I do that with, in some of my courses, when I'm allowed to. Every platform won't allow me to do this. But when I'm allowed to, I try to add, you know, optional exercise to every single chapter that I teach so that you can, you listen to me. I go through an actual real world example as I'm teaching you. And then I give you another real world example, a problem to solve with the information that I've just taught you. And I think that's- So you can do it yourself, right? Yeah. So you can do it yourself without me. Like, it's easy to follow along when I'm showing you, but I want you to be able to do it yourself. And you might have to replay the video or look through the transcripts. That's fine. Right? That's what we do as developers. But I think applying that knowledge is the key, and many courses are missing that. And that's why these folks are having a hard time on the job. So I think we could still do the fun projects. Like I said, mine might be a game, but it's really making you think and exercise these concepts. We've talked about this on Twitter too, where people are building portfolios and they're not building portfolios that are reflective of the jobs that they want to get. And often that's a tough hurdle that you have to get past because you have to build something real to get a real job, I think, at the end of the day. Yep. Yep. And they are really struggling with that. One of the interesting disconnects that I've seen, and I don't know if you've noticed this as well, is when we're working, it's like this neat thing where you have product and engineering and marketing, and you have the C-suite and they're changing stuff on you. And have you ever thought about how you might simulate that in kind of a training environment to actually give people a chance? No, I haven't, and that's a really good observation. When we're teaching courses, it's very much an isolated experience, right? This is very independent. You're studying on your own. Even if you think about school settings, you get penalized if Google and find a solution, or if you work with someone else and it's not a group project. I think that's... And I didn't learn about a lot of that stuff, Joel, until I went to do my master's degree, is when they taught about software engineering, not programming, but software engineering, and talked about all of those different roles that come into play. Yeah, I know that there's a couple of interesting novels that have been written in narrative form that try to show people that, and I've heard like Microsoft does, they're internal, and they actually hire actors and kind of simulate the work environment. And I think that's an amazing concept, but I just haven't really even seen that. And even in my own teaching, it's always, here you are, we're talking about this, it's in isolation, you're working by yourself, you have some assets, but it's not... You're collaborating with a designer, which is a lot different than being handed a design or having to create your own. Have you found any way to test your learning content? When you're creating a course, are you able to test that with people, or do you just kind of create it for the event or the platform that you're building it for and kind of test it in production? So the ones on TAU, I didn't test those, I basically just let it ride. But on some other platform, like LinkedIn Learning is another one where I have courses, and they have a set of testers that take the course before it's released. And I thought that was really neat and helpful. And they'll call out continuity issues, and this isn't really clear, you kind of lost me here and there. So that's been very beneficial. Would that actually affect the course? Would you go back and fix those things or improve based on that feedback? Yeah, yeah, I do. I go back and I may have to record another little snippet, clarifying point, or something like that. It's a pain. But you know, if I feel like it's really necessary, then yeah, I'll do it. When you were building Testing Automation University, is that something that y'all built from scratch? Or did you use a framework or platform for that? Yeah, we built that from scratch, I actually hired a contractor to build that out. I didn't want to build it that way. But we decided to go that route, just to have a more flexible platform that we can add whatever features we wanted to. But if I were to do this all over again, I think I might go with, what do they call it? Learning management system. Okay, like a kind of a formal enterprise learning management system. Yeah, I hear those are pricey though. But that's true. Yeah, but I would rather go with that. It's a lot of work to deploy just a single course, right? Like I'm literally in here, I had like editors, and I'm converting transcripts to Markdown and all of this stuff. It was quite the effort, it would take me like a day or two to deploy a course. If you were designing, or you could snap your fingers and have the ultimate course platform at your disposal, what are some of the features that you'd have to have that you'd want to have to make those problems go away and deliver the better learning experience? Let's see, I would, I definitely need video, transcripts, quizzes, I really like gamification type things, so points. We added some things on Test Automation University, leaderboard and stuff like that. So for those who like competition, that's really fun as well. I like a lot of the elements that Josh has, what's Josh's last name? Yes. Yeah, his stuff is great. And his CSS course, like the interactive elements there, I would totally steal that sort of thing. It's inspiring what he's done, and just that ability to go through and touch the screen and have something happen, and it just ingrains it right into your brain, and I love it. Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that makes you want to come back and take the next lesson. I think gamification kind of gets a bad rap, like people think about that, and they think of tokens or something flying up in your face or whatever. But how has that improved the learner experience and people that have interacted with testing automation? It's been wonderful, right? So they have quizzes, and you get points for the quizzes, and like I say, we have a leaderboard, we have a TAU top 100, and so the people who are in the top 100 are pretty competitive, and so they end up taking any and every course that we put out because they want to get their points up and keep their slots, right? But I just think of, wow, think about the sort of tool belt that this person now has. We have our courses on test automation university are split amongst API and mobile apps, and so you're learning all of these different lanes and everything about them, right? How powerful is that? But yeah, they really enjoy it. We give little cute badges upon completion, so people share those and they share their certificates and things like that. So it's not an in-your-face kind of thing, but it's still really fun. So I was talking to Aman Zabi, who does the terrain.com is their course platform that they built. And I want to run this idea by you because I think it's one of the most interesting gamification techniques and kind of maybe aligns with your current interest, but they've taken and they give participation points to the learners, and at the end of the month, they take that pool and then they actually profit share with the learners. So the most learners that participate them end up actually getting, they pay out in crypto and cash and give people like actual money for participating and taking the class. And I've never heard of that before. And I think it's like one of the coolest kind of modern web three ways to incentivize the people to do the activities of learning that you're trying to get them to accomplish. What do you think of that? I think that's really neat. That's really neat. I wonder how that's working for them. Some folks are just not motivated by money, though. It's true. It's like an extrinsic motivation. And I think it's their way to teachers assistance and people that are active and community and helping others more than like, you know, like actively learning. And I think that's part of it, too. But it's like, how do you get people in the community answering and, you know, like being part of that and really helping, but then fairly compensating them, too, because that's work. Right. So that they're going for. No, I really like that. And those are the people you kind of need. You need those community members that are lending a hand and things like that. So it's really nice to recognize and compensate them a bit. For me, it's tricky, too, because I don't want to like I don't want to exploit the community. I don't want them to literally doing labor for us, a commercial business and, you know, not getting compensated for it fairly. So I thought that was just a clever way to do that and kind of help motivate people and, you know, share, share the success of the platform with the people that are using it. You built a learning platform and you had help and somebody built that platform for you or worked on. But at some point you are having to think about the platform and the delivery and the learning experience. And I'm wondering, how do you balance platform and creation and design of the delivery mechanism, co-creation of the content that people are going to interact with the courses? Yeah. Fortunately, in the beginning, we had to focus on both the platform itself, but then also we really needed to put courses out. So I kind of tag team this with another co-worker and had that co-worker focus on the platform stuff while I focused on getting the courses out. Once the platform matured, then it was less work. It was more just maintenance there. Here and there, we might have a request for a new feature or something, but most of the attention was needed on the course. What makes a really good course? We've talked about it a little bit, but just if you're going to describe the kind of what, how does it feel and what goes into a really good course? Okay. A really good course. I think one is a good needed topic, right? Two is the length of the course. So anything that's too long, I found people don't finish them. Yeah, that's true. That's true, right? They won't finish them. So you have to be mindful, even if it needs to be like a part one and a part two or something like that. But the length of that course, I found the happiest spot is about an hour. What have you found, Joel? It really kind of depends and you got to break it down and people's attention, Wayne. So if it's a live workshop, four hours, like it is really after that, like people just glaze over. And then when you're trying to get people to go through a course, I feel like, you know, you have to break it down into chunks at the end. It might be a longer course. It might be a four hour course, but let's break it down into chunks. So at each module, each hour increment, you're getting like some value and you're achieving something so that, you know, like you've achieved it. You can stop, come back later. Yeah. Yeah. And then also another element for a good course, again, is the engagement part. I think that's what really keeps them because you're not just listening. I do kind of code along style, so you can watch me if you wanted to, but I encourage people to like code with me. And then at the end, I offer an exercise of their own. So I think that really gets them bought in, you know, they've now invested, they've worked on some problems, they've solved them. They feel really good about that and they continue on. So like my, I have a Java course on Test Automation University that's about six hours long. So it's a really long course and if I look at that one compared to other ones that may be three or four hours, the completion rate is much better. And I, that definitely is attributed to the engagement factors that I've placed in there. So some of the other ones are long, but there's no exercises for folks in that. How do you balance the, as you mentioned video, and I think video is a great mechanism for delivering certain types of content, but how do you balance the text and the quizzing and that sort of thing with video and what seems to be most effective? So for accessibility reasons, I hired an editor that would, or a transcriber that would essentially take every video and it's not just the text, right? They actually make that into almost like an article. So they're incorporating like pictures from the video, the code snippets that the instructor is going over and embedding all of that right in the transcript. And I did that for accessibility reasons, but I was really surprised to see how many people were using those transcripts. So some folks were using them as opposed to the video and many people, I think it was like 60% were using it as a compliment to the video. So they would let the video play and let the instructor speak, but they were reading and following along with the transcript, which I thought was really interesting. Yeah, that's something I do. I'll watch the transcript or read the transcript while listening to it. On 2x speed too, I like to do that. I'm listening to it on double speed while I read because I find videos kind of slow sometimes. So if you read it, you feel like that's... Yeah, so I'm kind of processing it visually and then, and it depends on what the video is, right? If somebody is actively coding or they're doing something or it's something, you know, take out like a woodworking course. I can't, you can't read about woodworking. It just doesn't work. But a lot of times when it's more of a either, you know, like a knowledge work type of course, I'll be able to follow the transcript and it's honestly how I can podcast too. I pull up a transcript, I import them into Otter, pull up the transcript, listen to it on 2x and watch it run through the transcript while I watch it listen at that speed. So it's kind of engaging and gets me through it in a quicker way. Okay, I want to try that on my next, the next course I take, I'm going to try that approach. How important are completion rates in a course? Do people, is it, you know, is it really important or can people get what they need and get out? Or how do you put weight on the completion rates in a course? You know, when we first launched AU, I would get questions about, you know, from my, from folks working there. I would get questions about the completion rates and what can we do to improve completion rates? And it wasn't something that I even thought of like monitoring. I didn't really care about that. And I don't know if that's just me being naive or what. I care about, unless there's some sort of, you know, issue, oh, this is the quality of the course is not good or something like that. But other than that, I just don't think people finish things. They just don't, like, I don't finish things, right? I take courses sometimes and I got what I needed, I'm done. Or this isn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be. So I screw this topic all together kind of thing. Yeah, so I don't even, I don't put much weight on that at all. I think it's because it's like the only metric outside of following up and talking to them about their success and what the course actually did for them, which is labor intensive and difficult. So you can just take, well, we can automate this and see how many actually finished. And it's, you know, it's something to look at. It's a debated topic, actually. Do you think it's more important how many people started it or how many people finished it, or equally as important? The only real measure of success for me in any of this is whether the students achieve the difference in their lives that they're set out to achieve in the first place. And if we're accomplishing that, we're doing a good job. It's just hard to measure that unless you are really, you know, invested in their approach. And it's particularly difficult when we're talking about creating self-paced courses, you know, like an egghead course. Start and finish it. We get it. There's this cliff after the first video. I'm literally every one of them. And you can kind of see this cliff after videos one and two and people fall off. They just, you know, this wasn't for them. The instructor isn't for them. They don't like the style, whatever. And then, you know, how they go through it after that is varied. But often people just, they're trying to solve a specific problem, a technical problem. They get their answer. They get to move on in their lives and, you know, go about their job. And that's why they watched the course in the first place, because they were going to solve a very specific thing. And it either did it or it didn't. And that to me is success. And that's how I measure it or try to into my ability. I like that. Angie, thank you so much for chatting with me. It's always interesting. Where can people find out what you're up to on a regular basis? Yeah, check me out. I live on Twitter at TechGirl1908. I also have a website, AngieJones.Tech. Thanks, Angie. Yeah. Thank you, Joel.

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm excited to talk to you, you've been building a course platform of your own from scratch and I'm intensely interested in kind of the motivations and technical hurdles that people are facing when they're building a course platform and how they think about that. But before we get into that, I was wanting to ask you, how do you personally approach learning when you come into something that's complex, whether it's something, you know, in your programming life or otherwise, when you're learning a new complex topic, how do you think about it and approach a new subject? I think it depends on mostly if I know what I don't know yet. If I know what I don't know, I try to go for specifics. For that, I actually use Egghead a lot because I like I can go straight to the specifics, get what I need, and then start using it. When it's something a bit more broad that I'm not sure what goes into it that I don't know. I was trying to learn about building Express APIs, but I had no knowledge about Express. Then I go for something more broad, more complete. That teaches me what I don't know yet. Like for example, Westbos courses and things like that. Right. So it's kind of, it really depends on where you're starting from and the known unknowns and if you're completely new or if you have some experience and just need specifics. So it sounds like you like to take courses and courses are part of your learning experience. Is that over books? Do you prefer taking a course before you'll reach for a book these days? To be honest, I don't think it's about the format. I think it's more about who created it. I have both. I take a lot of courses mostly. The ones that are not, because I have, I think the only platform I'm subscribed right now is Egghead. So whatever I don't find in Egghead, I get courses from Westbos or Kent. I never get to pronounce the last name, Kent C. Dodds, I think. Yeah, that's it. You nailed it. And things like that. But sometimes I also get books. For example, for most of the UI things I do with Ionic, it's always books, but mostly because the authors are people that I already know and that are really good at explaining themselves. So it's a vibe that you have with the creator of the material versus the format itself. You're not as concerned about format. It's how is it delivered and do you trust the source, too, I suspect? Yeah, I believe that's the biggest part, trusting if that person will help me get where I want to be. What are some of the qualities of your favorite courses? Like when you take one and it's really effective, regardless of who delivers it, what do you really like to see when you're using that format? Lots of examples. Like things that I can start trying immediately that are not like a big build up. I don't know if you've seen that where you see two or three chapters in a book trying to build something and it's just a day you do this, but you don't get to see the results up until, I don't know. You're not running it, right? You're just, you're kind of, you keep building it and you don't get to see it and you see no results. And then finally, it's ta-da. Exactly. That's a big one for me because sometimes you spend hours trying to build something and then when you get to that point, you see, okay, it's not working. There is an issue somewhere and then you need to figure out where the issue is. So when it's more, you start building something and testing it immediately. You get that, like that really close or really fast feedback loop. So you know that, you know if you are on the right path or on the right track. So you also teach people and I'm curious, what's your relationship between how you personally do research and to learn something on your own and the research process that you would perform to create a new course that you are producing? For me, there are two parts of the research process. One is like I took 30 by 500 by Amy and Alex. So I do a lot of safari. Most the official Ionic blog or the Firebase mailing list, those are like my two big sources and I try to find patterns there to see what people keep bringing up. And the other one is my own newsletter. Like right now my newsletter is close to 5,000 subscribers, like 400, 4,000 something. So whenever I start getting like common questions or the same question over and over, I know, okay, this is a good topic for an E-bomb or this is a good, something I can expand more to create something a bit bigger, like a course or a short book or something like that. You said E-bomb and E-bomb is like a piece of content that provides value that you send out like a blog post or one of your newsletters, right? That's from Sales Safari, which is part of 30 by 500 that Alex Hillman and Amy Hoy created. Just to provide some background for folks that haven't heard that before. And I can't agree with you more on the examples being a huge important component of building a course. And I think something that people get stuck on when they're designing learning material is what to come up with for examples. And I was wondering if you had consistent sources of inspiration for that, or how do you decide what to? There are mostly two. First is if I've used whatever it is that I'm trying to teach in my day-to-day job. We do a lot of enterprise development for logistics companies. So we usually get to play around with a lot of new things and a lot of complex things. So if I've done something there, I try to adapt from what I already. If not, I try to ask directly my newsletter, my mailing list, but not asking, what do you want me to build? More asking, okay, I'm working on this subject. Have you built something with this? Have you struggled with something? Is there anything that you need from me? Do you need any help? And with that, I usually go through the answers and see, okay, what people is building? Or if someone asks for help, I help them directly and then see if anything I did there is something that I... How important is it that examples or exercises that you roll into learning material be related to the real world? Because you mentioned the enterprise and I think that's interesting because I feel like a lot of software training kind of diverts from the enterprise level of software creation. And I'm wondering how do you kind of keep it grounded in that while still keeping it interesting for folks? I think that if the closer you are to real world examples, the easier it is for people to imagine themselves doing it. If not, when you try to build something and you say, okay, I want to showcase this functionality and you just try to go with whatever it is you want, I feel that the people reading it or watching the video can tell from that. I think that they get something different when it's something that is actually for use. That it's not something that you build for an example, but that it's something that has a real application, a real use. How do you know when somebody succeeded when they're taking one of your courses? What are some of the signs you look for of success for learners? That's a difficult one. I usually try to have automated emails a week, two weeks later after they go through an ebook or a course or something like that. But I feel like a lot of people don't really reply. When they reply, they try to make you feel good. So yeah, I went through the book, it was really good and you can tell by the generic-ness of the response that they were just trying to be nice. So I try to ask them for specifics. What would you change? What was difficult for you? Did you have any issues when you were trying to implement something and things like that to see? It is really hard because people will try to save your feelings. It's like when you're teaching. I've taught a lot of live workshops and when you stop and say, does anybody have any questions? And you know that they have questions because there's no way that they don't. But nobody's hand goes up and it's very challenging to get that sort of candid feedback, I think. Yeah. I was a teacher in a university before going into tech and it was like that. Nobody had questions, but as soon as the class was over and everyone was leaving, a few people would always come to the desk like, hey, could you help me with this? I didn't understand that and things like that. It's interesting because it's more of a one-on-one, right? Like they were in that situation, they didn't want to raise their hand in front of the group, but afterwards and they're going to express their questions because it's more private, I guess. Yeah. Did any of your experience as an educator or teaching at university, has that translated or what have you carried over from that experience into being an online teacher for software developers? I'm not sure if it's that it has things that have carried over. It's more like it became the reason why I started doing it. More than programming, I like teaching, but I don't know how it is in the US, but it's really hard to make a living, a good living as a teacher here. That's everywhere. Yeah, it's everywhere. So I was trying to say, okay, what can I do that can combine that, that I can start or that I can keep teaching, but at the same time, I need to be able to provide. So that's how it all started. I started writing blog posts, trying to help people and trying to teach, trying to write and things like that. Not sure if specifics of what I was doing in the past has carried over to my courses or my books or something like that. For me, it was more like the reason it all started. Yeah, the kind of the journey and I would assume some of it has to affect it just because you're comfortable with your ability to, but not directly translating from classroom university experience to what you're teaching now. So you've been teaching for a while and I was wondering, have you seen any success stories from students that have motivated you or kind of kept you going? What sort of feedback in that regard, like where you can witness their success, not necessarily them telling you that they've been successful, but have you witnessed success? I had, this was a really cool experience. I was invited to a meet up in Medellin about Angular and I met two people there that approached me after my talk was done and they actually said that they had bought my first book. It was a book I remember about getting started with Ionic and Firebase. They were building websites in their company and because of the book, they said that they had been able to move from the web team to the mobile team and that they were able to get a good promotion, a good raise because of that. That feels good. Oh, really good. I was just like on the clouds that day. And other than that, it's mostly when you see people that keep writing to you to, not to tell you that the course work or that the book was good or something like that, but when you see that they keep asking or bringing up different type of issues, different scenarios, different situations, like they are able to keep growing. You see that they are not asking now, I don't know how to connect to Firebase and fetch data, but you see that they are asking more about, okay, how can I do the transaction so that if several people at the same time are trying to edit a document, they don't overwrite the data and things like that. You see their questions go up in skill level and can witness them actually increase their knowledge and understanding. Yeah. That's awesome. Because not a lot of people reply and reply multiple times to the newsletters, but the few that do that, like you start to remember the names and you see that, oh, it's him again. Oh, it's them again. And things like that. And you see, and you're able to compare what you were talking about a year or two in the past to what you're talking about now. So something I'm interested in, I've been building a course platform for many years and I noticed that you've constructed your own course platform and I think that's something that software developers will lean more towards than other folks, but I'm wondering why not just use something that exists on the market? Like why not just use Podia or Teachable or something that's already existing and instead build your own course platform? What has that done for you? Okay. At the time that I made the decision to build it, it was not really because the other ones that were out there were lacking features. I was just not interested in them at that point, but it was mostly because I felt that some of my skills were like getting rusty because the type of work I've been doing for the past year and a half has been a little less technical and a little more managerial. So I decided to have something on production on my own, something that people were going to use, something that could break, that I could see why it broke, that I could fix. So it was more of a selfish type of things to keep my skills sharp. It was the course platform because when I was thinking, okay, what do I build? It was like, okay, I have a good deal of content. Let's just go with this one. I know that people are going to use it and I know that they can tell me when something breaks or what I need to fix and things like that. When you describe the platform that you built with JS Mobile Dev, the course platform, how do you describe it or what kind of features are most essential to you as you build the platform? There are a lot of things in my mind that I would like to implement, but right now what I see it is a simple, it's a place where people can, like you go in, you log in, you get to the content that you want to learn and that's that. Right now I don't have anything fancy. There are a couple of things that I would love to get the time to implement soon, but right now it's just that. It's there and it help you get the content that you need. If you could snap your fingers and have, you know, like any feature added to your course platform, what would you, what would be the first thing then? I would like to have a way for people to automatically add context to the questions of their request for help. I don't know, maybe you are watching the third video of a course and you have a question there and that you are able to just click something and that could be information about the video, what part of the video you are on and I don't know, things like that. So that it's easier for me when I read the question to be able to like, to see, okay, where do I start answering this? What have they done and things like that. We've been building something similar where it's this idea of context within video training is really difficult, right? It's a, it's kind of a dense medium and allowing them to comment and ask questions in, in the context of the time code of the video. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's something that we've literally been working on that for a year and it's a very challenging thing. I'm with you. I'm going to cross my fingers and get that same feature. I think that's a good one. Have you noticed any advantages or anything that's felt really good to you in terms of having complete control over your platform and the delivery of it? Do you think it's enhancing the learning experience? I'm not sure. I would say that if I had more time, yes, I would see a lot of benefits because like I said, there are things that I would like to have that maybe they are not available someplace else, but it's not a real benefit at the moment because I just don't have the time to build it. Yeah. And you're, I mean, you're balancing a full-time job and doing this also, so I'm sure that really kind of bites into your time as having to work. Yeah. How do you balance that then the idea of working on the platform versus creating or maintaining the material for the platform? Because it's two different things. It's two kind of radically different jobs. Yeah. It's really hard. Right now, start, I believe was the second week of January, I moved part time because I truly want to like to dedicate more time, not only to the course platform, but to actually generating more content. So that's the only thing I could think of to be able to do that because having the full-time job plus creating the content is not really something that I think it's impossible, but having the full-time job, creating the content and then adding the features and then fixing the bugs. Yeah. It takes a lot of time and I've always wanted to be a company of one, like I have absolutely no interest in creating a big company, having employees, partners or anything like that. So it's just me. So it usually takes a lot of time to be able to do things. So I'm curious, and you're a professional and you're a professional software developer and it sounds like you've got quite a bit of experience, but has there been any surprising technical challenges while through the process of building your platform? There have been challenges. I don't think it's because they have been extremely difficult, it's more just trying to do something too fast. It makes you be a little bit careless. Just a quick example, I had a bug in the registration process because when I created it, it was working fine. Like people would go get a course, sign up, it will create the account, add all the necessary data and they will have access. But then that cloud function would break if the user already existed in the platform. As I said, there are a lot of personal things going on right now, so time is non-existent. So I had to quickly just turn off the function and put the videos available for download while I get the time to be able to fix that. Yeah, so it's just kind of technical, it's the complexity of the system more than any specific surprise that has popped out at you. And you shared some of this, that you want to do this full-time and be a company of one, but what's the long-term goal of building your own platform, creating these courses? I think that my long-term goal is more related to creating the content than to maintaining the platform. I believe that with enough time, I can get the platform to a decent level where I can just focus mostly on not having to spend too much time maintaining or adding things and focusing more on the content. It doesn't matter the amount of features you have, the, I don't know, the expanded levels of performance, if there is no good content that people can go and check out. That's the truth. Yeah, I think that's true too. And you know, like all the fancy features or delivery mechanism really doesn't matter if the content isn't effective at the end of the day and doesn't get people to where they want to be. Jorge, I got to say, I really enjoyed talking to you and appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. And I'm very excited to see what you do and see where you take this and see what kind of content you deliver. I bought one of the courses and I did it for research for this, but also because I'm very interested in the content that you teach. It's relevant to my interests otherwise. So thank you for that too. I'm looking forward to digging in more depth and again, thank you so much for chatting with me today. All right. It was my pleasure.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey, thanks for having me on. I'm excited about this. Yeah, I'm really stoked to talk to you. We have a lot in common. You've inspired my business from years ago. I think we've been chatting since 2014 or 15 and we have a kind of similar business models and do a lot of the similar work and are stoked by some of the same activities at the core of it for me, and I know it's similar for you. It's, it's first and foremost, like being a web developer is something that I still get such a kick out of. And this job allows me to do that in a way that I get to control and that's fantastic. I want to kick it off though, and ask you, how do you approach learning something new and you sit down to do something technical, complex that you haven't done before. What's your learning approach? Yeah. So my approach is a bit different than the people that take my courses, which is funny, but like the type of person that's taking my course is someone who wants like a linear path and to be sat down and to be shown everything for. So for me, when there's not necessarily a course out there or just my learning approaches, I sort of just try to like binge information on the topic. So whether that's watching all the conference talks, like you can learn a lot by throwing on a YouTube conference talk, you skip the first five minutes, you put it on 2x and just blitz through that thing. You watch three or four of those. And I always talk about like surface area of a topic, really good for understanding like what it does, like what it covers, what it doesn't cover, how to use it, and then I'll usually blitz through the docs, look at examples, and then just get into building three or four different things with a specific tech. It's sort of my hands-on approach to getting dirty and learning something. You find it's technology mostly that you're doing that? Or do you have other areas where you, of interest that you're pursuing? All the time with everything. Like last year I put in, we have a cottage up north, it's unlimited water. You can pump, so I put in spring, a huge sprinkler system. And like, I just went, I went all in. I watched all the YouTube videos. I read all the things I went down the rabbit hole, learn all the math of pressure and flow, those things are trade-offs and like, I just, I went all in on it and I know literally everything you need to know about sprinkler irrigation. And now I'm done and onto the next thing. And like my entire life is boat engines, carburetors, fixing ATVs, like all. I just go nuts on a certain topic. I learn it really well. And then to move on to the next thing. And I don't abandon those things, but I just know how to do those things now. And then I go deep. I do a deep dive on something else. And it's funny. You're not trying to, I've seen that with the ATVs in particular. I'm always like, when you, or you buy the toy cars for the kids and then soup them up, right, and go and they're broken. So you can pick them up for cheap and then go ahead and fix them. And I think that is so fun. It looks so interesting. It's not like you're going to do that for a living. I mean, no, but no, I probably wouldn't. I wouldn't, I did make quite a bit of cash flipping bikes when I was in university and up until about five years ago, which was really fun for me. Cause I like working on my hands and it's business, but it's also learning how things work. But that's not my, I just do that because I enjoy getting into something new. So, and I assume it's different and probably the same when you have, you know, some sort of new course topic or you found something that you think you want to teach, what's your research project process for something like that? Is it different than how you would approach learning something for personal? It's pretty similar. Like just read through absolutely everything, build four or five things. Um, like I never want to be the guy teaching something who just made a to-do list and teach us how to do that. Like you have to know more than that. You have to know like more surface area. You have to actually hit the bumps and issues that people run into. Otherwise your course is just too like, it's too thin. It's okay. Yeah. I too can do the hello world on something, but what about real projects? Like what about real issues that we all run into? You know, you don't cover that. So I always try to make at least three or four things in the specific tech that I'm doing, um, of, of different sizes, but of like different, like areas that you hit, like maybe is heavy on data. Maybe another one is heavy on permissions and authentication. And maybe another is big on the integrations with another API. Right. And then I usually just have a feeling of, okay, I feel pretty confident that I would be able to build something in this. And then you sort of reverse engineer that saying, okay, what are the things you hit, what are the things you need to learn? Um, and then what can you build in a course or how do you teach that in many lessons, um, to cover all of those things? So people get their, uh, people are get their money's worth and they're able to learn what it is you need to learn on that tech. Are you using any sort of kind of learning design framework or is it something you've built up over the years for yourself as you've taught and explored that space? Yeah, I use like mind mapping software and usually what I'll do when I'm at a point where I'm like, okay, I know the tech, what do I need to teach people? I'll just do a, like a brain dump of all the things that need to be covered. And then that will slowly morph its way into a, a mind mapping software. So you have one, one major topic, and then there might be a couple of branches off of that, right? And then by the time I'm done, I'll have all of the topics that you need to learn and all the subtopics that need to learn. And I can then turn that into, uh, an actual course. So I don't have any set framework. It's just kind of in my brain that I know how to approach. I know in the past, you've talked about like live teaching and actually teaching people more of a classroom setting. It has been very important. Is that something you still do? I know times have been weird in person, but is that still important part of your process? I haven't done that in a while. I did do quite before COVID I, I still did, I don't know, three or four workshops per year, but before that I was doing for years, I did bootcamps and evening classes and like, I feel like I got a really good handle on how people learn and how people hit issues just because of the, that in-person energy you get from people where you explain something and it bombs, or you explain something and there's excitement in the air, you know, and I feel like I have it pretty dialed in, um, based on that in-person feedback. So I was, I'm very happy about that. And I still do really enjoy doing like workshops and stuff. I get tons of requests to do it. It's, it's kind of hard now. I've got three young kids and I did a lot of that before I had any kids. So I don't do it as much anymore. Do you do any, have you done any kind of zoom live stuff or that sort of workshopping? I just haven't, I've had a lot of people ask about that and I just, I don't know that I could like, a, I don't want to come up with the content. If I have a workshop, like usually what I'll do is I'll make a workshop and I'll do that many times over. Right. But I don't have any workshops that are up to date right now because of COVID. And then I've had a couple of requests for zoom, but just hasn't been something like, eh, I don't really know that I enjoy teaching that in person over zoom. It's maybe something I should try, but it's just, there's only so much time in the day and I think my time is better spent making courses. And well, the energy is different too. I think a live workshop where you're in the person and you know, you talked about the benefit for you as being able to feel the energy in the room and you don't get the same sort of experience on zoom. It's there, but it's not the same. Yeah, I agree. So when somebody comes to, you've got how many courses are you up to? Oh, I don't know. Probably over 13, something like that. A dozen courses. And they're focused on web developers, I think almost exclusively. What are people trying to achieve? What are the learners? What's the big themes that people are trying to achieve when they encounter your courses? Yeah, it's kind of a mix. A big portion of my learners are people who they're at a job and that job needs them to learn this tech. The big one is Express. Tons of company, like Express is not the new hot thing, but I have a node course that covers all of Express and learns how to do it. And that's still very popular in the, like we have employees and we need to skill them up on this tech, take Wes's course and you'll be up to speed really quickly. So that's, that's a big one is that there's employees in a company need to be skilled up on their existing, or they're thinking about picking up a new stack and they need to learn a new, some new tech. Maybe they're thinking, okay, maybe we should pick up react for our project. So that's a big one. And then the other part of it is, and I'm not sure what the breakdown is, but it's people who are looking to improve their skillset so that they can get a better job in their current job, things like that, or just keep up to date and the tech that's changing all the time. Cause you know that, right? You know that one of the big drivers, and I assume that like for the Express course, you're getting companies that are buying multiple seats for their teams at that point. Do you take that into consideration when you sit down to design a course? Like this is going to be something that teams will be able to use, or this will be something that's, you know, for a beginner developer, how do you kind of divide that up and think about the audience before you even make the course? I don't know that I do that. I basically just say, this is tech that I use and I believe in and use to build my own stuff. I think people want to learn how to use it. So people will probably pay me to learn how, how to do that. Or in the case of the free courses, this is the courses. So this is something they need to learn. So that's part of it. And then there's also like stuff like Flexbox, grid, JavaScript, that just literally everybody needs to know how to learn. Right. Like that was a big thing with my Flexbox course when that came out and grid course when it came out, is that like, there's not a single dev on earth that doesn't need to learn this because it's brand new. Right. So that's a really good one for me as well. Cause it's very, very wide casting net there. It's new and it's good too. And that's the thing, right? Like with Flexbox, while this is something that you really should know, not just that you could know it, this is something that you probably want to know if you're doing web development at all. It's true. All developers are going to be able to use that. It's not just like this niche part of CSS. That's like print styles or something funny like that. What, what goes into the decision process? Cause you, and I think it's awesome that you release free content and give people, you know, this opportunity to learn without having to pay for it. And that's very inclusive and gives us just opportunity that people might not otherwise have. But what's the calculus for you? Like, how do you decide what's going to be free and what's going to be paid and when you're going to go big or when it's going to be something contained that you can offer for free? I think I'll do a, if something is, if something is like good to everybody, it's a wide casting net, Flexbox grid, JavaScript 30, like those are all things that I heard from my students. Like I need to learn these things. Where do I go to learn them? That's good for me. It's good for business. People take the course, they like it. Some of those people will end up buying a paid course. And then it's also just good for the general humanity of being able to put stuff out there. That's how I got started blogging and stuff. It's being able to put it out there for really anybody. It's like without getting too cheesy because this is a business, but like it's also really cool to, to see people being like, Hey, I took your courses and thank you so much. I was able to get my first job as a web developer, or I was able to get like a $20,000 increase in my salary. Like that means a lot to me as well, hearing those stories. So those stories seem like a great way to answer this question, but how do you know when somebody succeeded, like somebody's taking your course and what are the kind of the metrics for success that you see in the learners that you're helping? Yeah, I think it just enthusiasm of people recommending it to their friends. Obviously there's metrics of how many people are signing up and taking the course and getting through all the videos and stuff like that. I don't pay too much attention to that, but it's basically just do these things spread without me having to really hammer them and have funnels and CEO and all that stuff, right? If it's those things are important, but if spread around really well, then, then I know I've succeeded. And most of my courses do, I've got a little one on Markdown that like almost nobody will ever tweet about it or sign up for it, right? Like it's just a, and like Markdown is good. And I made it really quickly because I love Markdown, but it's not something that is going to change someone's life. Like being able to level up your CSS. Do you cross-reference those? So if you created something small in Markdown that you're giving out, does this reference to another courses where it might be useful? Sometimes I'll say, Hey, if you want to know more about this, the big one for me is I have a command line because everybody, every course I do, Hey, how did you get that prompt? What font is that? How did you, what's that theme? How did you do that? Cool. Auto-complete like all of those questions. And as much of a temptation is to go down those rabbit holes as you're, you're teaching it, you got to stay on track of what you're actually trying to accomplish. So it's really nice to be like skipping over this because draw the rest of the owl type of thing. I'm just saying, Hey, if you want to know how I got this cool prompt, there's actually a free course on that. And it's nice to be able to push them, but I don't like clip videos together to make full courses. It's usually just start to link, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like you can link it in the notes basically and tell people where to go. I think that's actually something cool. Speaking of notes. And I noticed you, you started to do this recently where you're taking your paid course and you've created notes, I assume from learners and yourself, and you're actually publishing those and giving those away. And I thought that was really interesting. I was wondering what kind of prompted that. Yeah. I, my beginner JavaScript course, that's a paid course. I like, yeah, it's the same thing. It's twofold. So I had somebody the entire course and I had them transcribed cause I need captions and things like that. And then I took those transcriptions and I had a technical writer make them into actual text notes. And that was huge. It was very expensive for me to get done. And then I just gave it away for free on my thing. And again, it's the same thing. A it's good for business. It shows up in search engines. People find it, people want it, but B also sometimes people don't like video and they want text, a text version of that. Right. So I thought I might as well just give that away for free. And then there's also something nice about being able to give literally how to learn JavaScript away entirely for free. I think it's pretty good content, you know, something nice about that as well. And like, I remember one time I, I was, I got mad that somebody was like stealing my course and giving it away for free. And I got so much pushback from people being like, no, like you, if people want to steal it, they should be able to steal it because they're learning JavaScript and they're trying to better their life. And I was like, kind of, but also like it's my business, you know, and that's what makes me feel better about trying to take down stolen courses, being like. If you do really want to learn for free, Hey here, I've paid somebody to put it into text or, Hey, look, I've got six free courses you can, you can take as well. So I don't know. It's just, it's a delicate balance there. You don't want to be the capitalistic guy. That's trying to just milk money out of this thing. Cause like I started from a passion of people learning to learn this stuff. Right. Yeah. And well, my, my approach and we've obviously, I think suffered from some of that too, where they're trying to do it. And there's like sites, pay sites in Russia where you can go and they charge to access the course and there's literally nothing we can do. And it's like, that's going to exist where I fight it. It's where somebody will just rip the course and then post it to YouTube. And my problem with that is like the people watching it don't necessarily know that it's stolen. Right. So they aren't bad actors where people, if they're going to a pirate site or whatever, it's, you're not really a customer anyway. But you know, if it's, if somebody is posting it just in full form on YouTube, those are the ones that I had to write a script that was the, the YouTube a-holes DMCA. Yeah. I've got one of those as well. Cause Google makes you do, Oh my gosh. It's like a big spreadsheet you have to generate. And I just made a thing. I was like, boop, I have the exact same 20. I had to write it twice. Cause I lost one in a computer migration. So I've written that script a couple of times, but it's handy. And I mean, you have to protect your copyright. Otherwise copyright is useless. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't, then at the end of the day, that is the norm and people basically have permission to take it. And I'll also say that like a majority of the web development community is extremely supportive and extremely cool. And that's like such a good thing. Our communities that people say, Hey, yeah, Wes is me. It probably has something to do with the fact that I actually do give a lot of stuff out for free. And people are willing to stick their neck out for me when something like that does happen. One of the things that I think is interesting about your approach in general is your examples. And JavaScript 30 is one of my favorites that I'll point people to and go, look at that. You, if you want to know if you're interested in JavaScript or you've gone to free code camp and learned a little bit, go there because here's these great examples. And I was wondering, like, how do you decide or what kind of drives the choices in what you create in your courses? Yeah, it has to be something that is real world enough. Enough is important there, I think, right? Like, not exactly because real world is maybe boring and repetitive, but. Real world is 90% edge cases. And like that, that's something that I have a hard time balancing sometimes is that do you go down the rabbit hole and write three times the code to hit that one edge case, or do you just leave it, you know, so like real, yeah, real world enough is very important. So that's one thing. And second, it's, it has to be fun. Like we've all console logged our brains out and done 99 bottles of beer on the wall and what's the foobar baz with the, what's the Fizzbuzz. Fizzbuzz, Fizzbuzz, yeah, we've all done those and those are great, but like usually get into coding, not because they want to loop over a list of things, want to learn how to loop over something when they have an array of stats that are up for adoption, or they want to be able to take in input from the user because a lot of people are saying like, oh, I would love to learn how to code because I have an idea for something or I would really like it, so all of my examples are stuff that are like, okay, I've had to do auto-completion before, or I've had to click a, click a checkbox, hold down shift, click another one, and the checkboxes between those two things are for you, right? Or I've needed something to scroll when you log in, or I've needed to persist something to local storage. And then there's like another bunch of fun stuff, which is like, how do you access the webcam and manipulate it? Or how do you change the voice of somebody's input? Or how do you visualize audio, right? There's a lot to that. So I want people to be able to look at my course and be like, I need that. I like, I need to learn how to do that. And also I want to have fun with it. And it's kind of funny because sometimes you see people that have implemented stuff on their projects and they say, I had to go back to JavaScript 30 and look at the nav example that we did. Cause that's exactly what we wanted to do. And I'm glad that you had a little example like that. Have you had anything unexpected come out of a student that's taken your course and they've made something and shared it with you that was surprising? Yeah. We had a, someone on the podcast who built a website and he ended up getting the attention of Kanye West or something like that. That was pretty funny. You can listen to the podcast on that. Someone sold a startup that was based on one of my code. And I thought that was pretty cool. I totally forget what it is. It wasn't like a major like Uber or something like that, but they got paid from something that they learned in my course. So I thought that was neat. I think that's just like the potentiality of what people can create if they learn these skills is effectively the, you know, scope of the internet, right? Like it's only, there's the skill that they'd need to learn to do the thing. But then once they have these skills, the things that they can do is just this amazing, whatever, right? Like, I don't know. I can't predict what you will build. Yeah. Oh, you see it like people I taught eight years ago in, in the class where they were working construction or being a server, they are now senior developers at Shopify, they're now very established careers. And in many cases are much better developers than I am. And it's amazing to see that all they needed was just like a little bit of a kick in the butt and to learn the basics. And then they had the aptitude to be able to just continue that on for eight years in a row, and now they are in an entirely different place, not to say that construction or server is a bad thing, but they just wanted to change out of that industry. Yeah. That was their goal, right? Like they, they had reached whatever ceiling or plateau and that avenue of their life, and they had a different goal and now they've found success. And frankly, I can understand why people would want to get into software where we can work remote and the salary is incredibly high on a lot of cases and that sort of stuff. So it's a good career and if you're into it, it makes it a nice transition. So you talked about real world enough and the idea of fun. And I'm wondering, where do you bridge the gap between fun and business, right? Because, I mean, there are people out there that are strictly looking to get into code to, you know, maybe as a hobby or for fun or whatever. But there is, you know, the transition from having fun and doing this and kind of the pub bits of this career. And then there's the business aspect of it. And is that something you even consider at all? Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Like it has to everything that we build has to be something that I would actually use myself or implement in myself. Like a lot of my courses, I'll say, hey, this is actually exactly how I do it on this part of my website. Or this is the thing I only am approaching it this way because I actually ran into that issue and show that. So I totally agree. Nobody likes like myself has to be fun for people to learn and to be engaged. Otherwise you give up. If it's too simple, people get bored. If it's too hard, people give up because it's like they hit bugs or whatever. Yeah, you just feel dumb and want to go do something else. Watch Netflix. Exactly. Yeah, it's a delicate balance between that. I don't necessarily know if I have a how I can tell you how do I bridge that. But it's certainly something that's always top of mind for me. I think the definition of fun is interesting for one thing. And I don't think fun means cute necessarily. It can be right. Like you can make something that's whimsical and cute. But like having fun to me, like if I'm sitting down with a database problem that's actually kind of challenging, but within my grasp and then I finally solve it, I probably had fun that day versus like doing something where it's fun and kind of the candy crush kind of kind of idea of fun, I guess. Yeah, I think what I love to see is people take what they build on my courses and they say, I see how I could make it work for my thing. And sometimes you see like someone to be somebody sent me the other day a website of they manage a whole bunch of hockey teams and they have tournaments and those those teams are relational to the tournaments and there's orders and arrays. There's players in those teams and they sent it to me. And it's funny because it looked exactly like what we built in the course, but it was entirely different in terms of the data set and the structure and all the logic as to how it was displayed. I was like that that to me, that's a success because someone says, I'm learning to code because I need to build this website for hockey teams. But and that was what we built was close enough. And I was able to sort of just turn my eyes over to what it is that I wanted to build and take it from there. So it's kind of cool to see as people, they either finish the course and then they start to build out on their own or they're three quarters of the way through the course and they start to say, OK, I think I got it. I'm going to start building my own thing and take the rest of the course, but apply it to what it is my goal is. Do you think completion rates are important in terms of courses or like you just said, like if somebody gets what they need out of it, is that really what? Yeah, yeah. We talked about that on the podcast the other day. Sometimes somebody gets what they need out of it. They say, I just really needed to know this one thing about how you manage databases or how you populate the GraphQL API. To me, that was worth the cost of admission and I'm done. But then at another point, yeah, that's it's worth finishing it entirely because that what good developers do, that's what people who are good at things in life, they can see it through because that last 10 percent is incredibly difficult in any project. And anyone that's able to push through that is that's just a good personality trait, in my opinion. Finishing is a superpower. I think a lot of people don't and it can set you apart if you are able to take something from start to finish, particularly in this career, because a lot of people aren't able to do that. And just showing up and doing the work until it's done is something to be said. Absolutely. Totally agree. How do you maintain your courses over time? Because it's kind of a struggle because technology moves. And I assume it's some combination of picking technologies that aren't moving super fast maybe. Or how do you maintain them over time? Yeah, I'll definitely pick a tech is either a standard and can be updated. Like CSS Grid, a perfect example, CSS Grid is not going to change except they're going to add stuff onto it. Subgrid is a good example. Easy. Just add a couple more videos. Hey, everybody, since this last was recorded, we have new features. Let me show you how you use them. Right. Let me show you the problem that we hit in this one thing. Now we can fix that in that one. So that's really easy if it's pinned to a piece of tech. It's a little harder when it's when it's moving parts. So I'll usually talk to if I'm using a library, I'll talk to whoever builds that library and say, hey, it's your plan. Like Keystone is a really good example is I was started building it on Keystone five and they said, hey, just heads up, we are doing a major to this type of thing. So we'll let you build it on the next version of it. And that was a good choice by me because otherwise the entire course would have been out of date. Right. So there's that. And then the other thing is sometimes you just got to rerecord it or deprecate the thing because it's just it's just too far out from what people are using this day. And that's that's just the name of the game, I guess. I would assume with something like React, it's obviously worth rerecording. Right. If you had your class based components and now you want to do hooks and all the good stuff that's in modern React. So that makes it worth it. And sometimes it's just you let people know, hey, this is old. You might still get some value out of it. But yeah, like my Redux course, I've deprecated it. You can still take it because that's the other thing is that people think, OK, well, this tech is out for a month, really the rest of it is garbage. But then you get other people being like, oh, our our company is actually built on the older version of it and our devs still need to learn that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So like you still got to keep it around for people who want to learn that. I find that sometimes really frustrating as if you.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"they don't update a website for a year and a half, even finding docs for the old version is sometimes really, really tricky. Oh yeah, because they just blow them out of the water instead of having some sort of versioning scheme and it isn't even valid anymore. I think it's interesting because you talk about the Redux and Dan Abramov, like when Redux was created, recorded an egghead course that's had like hundreds of thousands of people have watched this thing. And people are like, oh, and I'll get comments to this day where it's, oh, this is out of date. And I'm like, wow, you really missed the point where Dan Abramov is showing you how to build Redux and you're complaining that the technology is out of date. And I'm like, you can still learn something from, I don't think sort by new is necessarily the best way to pick the best and most useful learning content on the internet. And I think that's kind of something that I've noticed people tend to do. They want the new, when was this updated? Was this updated last week? If not, then it's bad. It's totally true. When I redid my blog, I was so tempted to take the published dates off because as soon as somebody sees that something two years old, they click out of it, right? But people get also mad when there's no published dates. So I didn't do that, but it's definitely something that, and it's valid at some point because we've all been burned by going down a rabbit hole and realizing, oh, this thing is, this is totally out of date or the UI doesn't look like this anymore, you know? So you've built your own platform. And when you started, I assume there wasn't such a choice, but why not use something like a teachable or Podia or something to do your thing? When I started, there was nothing like that out there. I guess some people were using Gumroad and then just downloading zips. That's actually how mine started as well. It was just a zip of video files and you had to play them yourself, which is hilarious because that would never be okay to this day. Now it's a whole viewing experience. And then I just love having the ability to have full control over the purchasing and the viewing experience and everything like that, because I don't know, you get the whole runaround. Hey, it'd be great if we added this company. Oh yeah, let me put that on our list. You never add that, you know? And then the best example is I had a problem where we had this parody purchasing power where I would get emails every day from someone who lived in India or whatever. And they said, hey, we don't make as much money as you do in North America or Europe. Can I get a discount? And it was really frustrating because absolutely, I want everybody to be able to afford these things and whatnot, I'm happy to do it, but I just can't emotionally do that every single day, figure out, okay, what's fair to you? So I rolled out parody purchasing power on the website. So if you visit it from a country where purchasing power is less than your standard big countries like Canada, United States, a lot of the European countries. And I was just like, okay, this is really easy for me to just check the country, restrict purchasing, buy coupons by which country they're on. And I was like, I never would have been able to do that if I was on one of these platforms. And of course they rolled it out eventually, but that was three or four years after I had implemented it. I don't think it's even really widespread, to be honest. I think Stripe is rolling it out on their own checkout, which is pretty cool. But yeah, it's just, you probably know this as well as being able to have full control over it. And also that's my baby, that's the thing that I work on. That's like my huge production application that has a lot in it. And if you wouldn't want to take a course for me, if I was the guy who just uses a software as a service or strings together 14 press plugins together, right? Like you want to see me actually building real software, is running a business that's paying people salaries. And that's, I also very much enjoy working on it as well. So there's something to be said for the developer who wants. Yeah, I mean, part of it has to be because you can. And I think that's an important thing to know, right? Like you are able to do that. And if you are able, then that's great. And for some folks, they can't kind of invent their own platform. Then those services are awesome, serve a purpose. But for you, you're able to build this thing that you call the boss monster. That's the name of your course platform. And if people want to like hear, you've done a couple episodes of Syntax FM, number 442 came out recently. And you and Scott get into how both of you approach your platform. So that's, we're not going to get into that depth. It's like a full hour of y'all just going full ham on how you do this. But how do you describe boss monster, your course platform? How do you describe that? What's the kind of the elevator pitch of your platform? So it's a node application that does, I think three or four major things. It does the landing pages. I call them marketing sites for all of my courses. Every course I do has its own domain name. So it powers all that. It powers the whole purchasing checkout experience. So that's like the main thing. Then there's a whole API behind that I can use for the administrative dashboard. So, and customers and refunds and changing names and whatnot. There's that's a whole Next.js application that's used for administrating all the data on it. Then there is the actual course viewing experience. So I want to view my courses. I want to see my receipts. I want to, I bought a team license. I want to send it to my team member. I'm an affiliate. I want to see how much money I've made this month. I want to actually watch the course. I want to click through the videos. I want to see exactly where I am in the videos. My progress is tracked, all that good stuff. So that's the biggest part of it probably. And then there's just a bunch of reporting in the note app as well. And things for taxes and when I have to remit to the government here, all that good stuff as well. Yeah, you got to automate that. Otherwise, just like tears of blood. Yeah, yeah, no kidding. That's the least favorite thing I could possibly think of doing. I love to automate that stuff. My taxes. Yeah, yeah. Is there anything that, you know, like, I assume some things have changed over the years because you've been doing this for a while now, but what stayed the same? What is the core that just hasn't really needed to move that you haven't felt the need to update or move on to something newer and better? Probably the funny thing is that the marketing sites for each course is a single page and that is server rendered. It's done in, it was in Jade for the longest time. It only got moved to Pug six months ago. It's styled with style and it's still, there's a little, maybe not. There might be a little bit of jQuery in there. There's a little bit of font awesome. That's just, and that will probably eventually, like the checkout experience needs to be totally rewritten into like a more dynamic app so we can accept more payment methods. But the actual, just like HTML rendered, there's literally nothing wrong with that. And I would see no benefit in updating that to React or Next or anything like that. Yeah, cause they don't, the marketing sites aren't also the delivery sites. The experience, it goes to the platform site where they're then inside of a platform and they have access to all of the courses that they purchase from you. Exactly, like that, the delivery is a React app because you need to click around and view the whole thing. But the actual marketing website is just a page and I could move that to some sort of static site generator but there's literally no use that, there's no benefit to that, you know? Like that's not gonna help my users, it's not gonna make me more money and it works really well. How do you balance this idea of actually working on your platform and creating new learning material? It sounds like the platform actually feeds learning material cause you can keep it real because you're still using the air quotes, real developer, whatever that might be. And you know, like what's the balance and like how do you decide what to do on a given day? It's just, if I'm working on a course, I'm working on a course and then like in between courses, I'll get a bunch of time to pushing through a bunch of stuff. Like the last couple of weeks, we did a big push to roll out the new viewing experience. It had a whole bunch of updates, it had notes and stuff like that. So it's pretty much just like, I don't call them sprints, but all right, I'm done that course. Now I'm gonna work on these couple of features that I wanted to do that. And I also have another guy who helps me on the course now, course platform as well now. And that's really nice because if there's bugs that pop up or features that I don't necessarily have time for, it's nice to be able to have those being worked on while I don't have to be distracted from actually working on the courses. For a long time, it was just you and then you brought on people and now you say we, when we're talking about your platform. And I was wondering what that transition was like for you to go from just being fully solo to like having people help and be able to convey information. So it's like me, AJ, AJ does the support. So if you hit a syntax error or anything like that, and then he also works on the course platform. So that works out really well. And then there is Whitney, she's my assistant. She does all of the administrative stuff, accounting and expenses and emails and protecting me from getting more than 300 emails a day. So it's been pretty good. Like I never wanted to be, I've like actively gone against becoming a big thing. You know, like I don't want tons of employees and meetings and all that stuff. Like I just wanna sit at my computer, hack on this thing, make cool courses and sell them. You know, like that's my dream. And I feel like I've got there. But at a certain point, things get hectic and you do need some help. So I feel like I have a pretty good balance between people helping me, but those people really know what I want. And we don't have to chat too much. And like we all- I would expect it didn't start that way though, right? Like how did you actually- Yeah. Go from not having anybody helping you to having people help you? Like how do you take those processes that are like all in your head or wherever you store them and then deliver them and get other people to understand? So I have them for the administrative, that's the biggest one. Because it's just, I have all these processes for what happens if somebody wants to upgrade their course or what happens if somebody is on a team and they give them the course and then they quit in two days. You know, there's all these things that come up and those are called standard operating procedures. And literally anytime something comes up twice, you take 10 minutes of your day, you write up a SOP for it, and then you have a way to approach it. And then like other things, like they sort of just know my voice and how I'd approach it. They know I'm very kind. So they have the ability just to give a free course to somebody if something happened or they bought the wrong one or whatever, you know? So there's that. And then also the nice thing about a developer who works with me is that he's taken all of my courses and literally knows how I write code because he's taken every single one of my courses. He was able to get pretty comfortable in the stack pretty quickly because it's the same as my Node course. So you and Scott Tulinski record a podcast called Syntex FM and it's amazing. You have stuck with it. Y'all have stuck with it for just the extent of the time that it just is mind-boggling to me. And I'm wondering, like how has the podcasting kind of played into it? Or how does that fit into your courses and just your job and work in general? The podcast was awesome. We just started it as, it's fun to chit-chat. Like me, you, Scott, and Josh had a mastermind and we really like just talk and shop. So, and then like he was already doing a lot of YouTube. I was already doing a lot of YouTube. So we're like, oh, let's try a podcast, you know? And nice thing about it is that we both had like pretty sizable audience for it. So we didn't have to go through that initial slog, 20 listeners a week, you know? Like we really hit the, and I always tell people that. I'm like, I think it's hard to start a podcast when you don't have an audience somewhere else. So we hit the ground running. We've been doing it for a long time and we just use it as a way to, like we advertise our courses at the very end. It's the last thing we do in the podcast called shameless plugs. And then it's also just like a great way to stay up to date on all the new tech because people ask us about all kinds of stuff and we got to do our research and we got to try this stuff and whatnot. So it's been good. And then also it's been like, it's been excellent for selling courses, good advertising. And it's also like, we've got sponsors and the sponsors pay us money to be on the podcast. So that makes money for us as well. So it's not like this like thing where, oh, let's just keep doing it because it's selling courses. But like the podcast itself is a business because there's advertisers that want to get on there. Yeah, it's great. And it's also like the, just the sticks of it has been just impressive because it is difficult to stick with something like that continuously over time. It's been the most consistent thing I've done in my entire life, I think. It's nuts. Like we've done two episodes a week for four years and it would just show up every Monday morning and we say, hey, what's up? And then we just, we do a little bit of work and then we just start hit record and go for it, you know? And we're in a pretty good flow of it right now. Yeah, and there's some, the catalog, and you've mentioned it a few times since we've been talking. I'll go listen to the podcast. I'll go, you know, now you can say that because you have this catalog and you can refer to it. And so you have a resource also and like a kind of an ankle thing where your children can one day go learn about their dad and at least a side of. It's nice to have a podcast where, like people ask me all the time, what's your core stack? And like we did one four years ago and now we just updated it last week because people ask all the time and it's nice to be able to point people to it. And we did another one on like sort of management as just a resource that people can point their family to. You know, like how do you explain two-factor auth to your mom or something like that? And now we made it and it's nice to be like, hey, go listen to this. Even if you don't, like wanna learn about web development, that one is just specifically about how do you manage your passwords? So beyond just making cool courses and getting to do what you want, do you have any kind of audacious goals as a developer or a teacher? I don't know. I think, like I'm at where I wanna be and I'm really enjoying it. And it's paying the bills. So I'm just gonna keep doing it. I'm very in tune with becoming burned out. And I'm very careful with taking on too much or getting anywhere. And oh yeah, like part of me is, oh man, I got this, I have this huge big email list. I've got this course platform. Like maybe I could do what you do and just run that for somebody else, you know? And sell a whole bunch of course. And part of me is like, yeah, I kinda wanna do that. But then the other part of me is like, I also just enjoy what I'm doing right now as well. So that's kinda like in the maybe down the road. But past that, it's just keep teaching people cool tech. Keep doing the podcast. Keep building cool stuff. And do that as long as you enjoy it. Well, you talked about that. And this stems from, and I just gotta tell the story real quick since we're chatting. So I was at a conference and we're sitting there and Egghead produces courses. And we have a lot of courses. And when you make an Egghead course, you make basically kind of lunch money or maybe if it's a really good one, you'll make rent money, but not pay the mortgage off money. And we're talking and somebody's like, yeah, we would do that. And I'm the foremost expert in Webpack right now. And we can make that. And it could be an Egghead course. But I really wanna make that West boss money. And I was like, I don't really know exactly what that means, but I know what West does, right? Like I know what goes into building a course and maintaining a platform and doing all this stuff. And what we did and internally, I was like, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna make West boss as a service. So we have software as a service and we do West boss as a service. And we've worked with Ken C. Dodds, Dan Abramoff and Emma Bostian. And released these different things and kind of released courses for people where it's a true partnership. You know, we do like revenue share and all that. And it works out. Like everybody's happy because they don't have to do all this stuff, right? Like they don't, they have to create the content and they get a chill and create the content and not worry about all of the support and handling requests and delivery and marketing and all that fun stuff. Because it's a lot of work. And it truly is like just a ton of work. And if you're sitting and doing it yourself, you can do that. And we often use this, you know, you can have a whole grape or you can share a grapefruit is the way we kind of phrase it. So, you know, I really think building a course platform can be something that's fundamentally rewarding and interesting if that's what you're interested in. And, you know, if it really is interesting to you, right? Yeah, yeah, that's true. And there's a lot of people that are experts in a specific topic because that's their full-time job. And they don't necessarily want to or have time to build it, market it, design it, you know, all of that stuff that is in addition to actually making the course. What makes me frustrated and something that I try to solve for is those folks that will never, they will probably never even write a blog post, right? Like they are so into what they do and their expertise, but what they do is so interesting. And it's like, how do you get those folks and amplify that expertise and then teach other people how to do those things is something that I really have kind of tried to figure out and it's like a long-term challenge for me, like how do you get this list of developers that will never do this thing to actually do something or at least, you know, be the expert in the production process, like that sort of thing. Beautiful, yeah, I agree. Wes, thank you so much for hanging out with me and chatting today, I really appreciate it. I appreciate what you do. I will continue to be impressed and inspired by your work and just can't thank you enough. Oh, thank you, I appreciate that, that's very kind. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm really excited to talk to you. I've had a chance to look at the course platform that you've been building, Terrain, and it's really great. And I like it because it's a subject matter that's different than the one I work on. I train software developers on our platform and you're primarily focused on entrepreneurs and that kind of spectrum. And there's a lot of crossover there probably as well, but I really love what you're doing and some of the philosophies that you're putting forth as a platform. Before we get started though, I wanted to ask you, how do you personally approach learning a new complex topic? I dive in head first and try and figure it out as I go. The last relatively complex topic I've tried to teach myself was probably bubble. And I just bought a template and tried to figure out how everything connected. And then whenever I hit a roadblock, then I'd go and look for a specific resource to solve that roadblock and then get moving again. What's bubble? Bubble.io is a no-code slash low-code visual programming software. It's what we built Terrain on. It's incredibly robust. Honestly, I think I discovered it because I think the universe realized I needed to learn patience. And that was the purpose of bubble in my life. It is the most exhausting piece of software I've ever had to use. But it's also, I haven't really come across any real limitations. What made you choose bubble or the kind of the no-code visual programming environment to build your platform? What was the driver there? So we were looking at traditional dev initially, and I'd gone as far as putting down a deposit and then COVID happened and the dev team got furloughed and I lost my deposit. So I was 20 grand out and we'd already announced that we were gonna be building Terrain. I didn't really have an out there. So I found bubble after I saw a couple of ads and I tried to build an app on it. It was with the help of a template, it took me about 48 hours. So I thought, this is possible. And then it took about four months to build Terrain on bubble. So is it aside from bubble, cause I don't know if it's all inclusive. I haven't used the tool. Are you using any other tools to kind of assemble and like coordinate the platform? We're using circle for the community part of it. We're using gather town for like the metaverse virtual space part of it. Zapier to link a bunch of things up, SendGrid for email and ActiveCampaign for marketing stuff. Do you think you're missing out by not having like a fully bespoke code, a full code platform, I guess? No, not at all. I mean, Terrain is incredibly flexible. Like we are able to build front end, back end simultaneously and deploy things right away. No one on my team has a professional dev background, but we've been able to, I mean, four months, I think is a relatively short period of time to get anything out the door. And for people with absolutely no background in any kind of product development, I think it speaks to how robust bubble is. And we have some pretty complex stuff going on on the back end, no real bumps at all when it comes to like building it. So I've spent 10 years and millions of dollars building a fully custom platform. And we're actually like currently in the process of stepping away from that ideology because like what we've run into is like, I'm a programmer and I have 20 years of experience developing software. So like, it's my first tool, right? Like I go to that, but like we're discovering like with our collaborators, because we're not like a software company, we're an education company. And in that sense, we don't need, like we're not building software solutions. Like the core of it's really in the courses and the content and the design. And the design of that material over the kind of the courseware, though there's like a baseline user experience that, and I think that there's a lot of ideas that you need to achieve as far as user experience goes. But it's cool that when I built it, there wasn't the no code revolution hadn't happened yet. So it's really interesting to see like this development of a full platform where you're able to serve people's needs in a robust way without having to, you know, like use Docker and Rails and Java, I don't know, whatever. Yeah, I mean, we have, I think like four lines of JavaScript on the entire site. And it's, yeah. What's a tool that you think people kind of are neglecting or maybe you wish existed since you've been doing this, this as a no code project, what's something that would kind of bring it all together for you if that thing exists? I mean, it's right now the only real way to link for if you're like link tools and do integrations is through Zapier. There isn't, and if integration for Zapier doesn't really exist, you're kind of in a spot where you have to get somebody to create an API for you. There is no good solution that I've found that like lets you create custom API with no code. I mean, that just isn't there yet. And that would be fantastic to have. So yeah. Have you looked at IntegraMAT? Yeah, I mean, Zapier, IntegraMAT, I feel like they're mostly in kind of the same wheelhouse. I know one of the things that we, like we had a lot of challenges with getting Vimeo to integrate with Bubble so that we wouldn't have to like, do things and go back and forth between it. And Zapier and IntegraMAT, they glitch sometimes. And that's super frustrating when people are trying to use your platform and like watch the courses that you've created. So we ended up having to get a custom API created for that. But if there was just a simple way to integrate tools that aren't already integrated, like if there was Zapier in a way like, that didn't rely on just the preexisting tools in there, that would be fantastic. Like I know there were- Where you could take action versus having to wait for the platforms to both of these platforms to actually do something and you're kind of stuck. Yeah. And you can do half of that now with webhooks, but like it's still not where it needs to be. So when you say you created an API, does that mean like you had to make kind of wrap the API and then you can use it or what does that actually, what does that entail? So we paid somebody to create a plugin for Bubble and that was, I don't know what they did on the backend, but they got Vimeo to interact with Bubble in the way we needed it to. And then we just added it as a plugin and it worked fine. So I wanted to walk it back a little bit and we skipped over this and what is Terrain? You built a course platform, it's Terrain. It's cool, it's for entrepreneurs. What is it and why does it exist? It exists because it was born out of a lot of frustration with the industry. On my agency side, The Scribesmith, we work primarily with course creators, but building a team and training a team and we were consuming a lot of courses and most of them were bad. I think the number was around 20 grand when I looked at how much we'd spent on bad courses alone. And it was super frustrating because I mean, there are good courses out there, but they're not necessarily the most popular ones. It's the ones with a good marketing team behind them that are really just getting all of that attention. And then on the flip side, despite being somebody who markets courses, I used to hate taking courses. The course taking experience itself was just not conducive to learning. Lots of platforms out there, they are selling internet real estate and creators are just paying to kind of upload the courses. So the end user there is really the creator and that's kind of who all the features from being catered towards the creator rather than the person actually taking the course. And Terrain kind of came out of all of those frustrations. And the idea was that we created a platform with high quality vetted courses that were actionable and designed to actually get people to finish them. So our courses are short. They're about, I think the longest one we have right now is about two-ish hours. They're all done in an afternoon type courses. Lessons are about 10 minutes long each. And every lesson, at least now with the pivot where we're switched to subscription model, all of the courses we're creating now have something really actionable that you can implement at the end of those 10 minutes. Templates, worksheets, all of that tied in. And then of course there's the community aspect of it. So we run weekly experiments with the community and they're encouraged to go out, test something in their business and then report back to see if it worked. Yeah. Our goal is to kind of turn it into a learning ecosystem rather than just kind of a course platform. So yeah. How do you balance the idea of building a learning platform for your instructor clients? So you have the people that are creating the courses and then the actual learners that are consuming those courses and who kind of comes first in that equation? So that was one of, so we actually launched Terrain December, 2020 and we launched, the previous iteration of Terrain was a commission-based model where we would license the courses from creators and then take 25% of sales. And when we were on that model, it was tricky because we had to balance creator expectations with learner expectations. We were serving two completely different groups of people. It was really challenging. And we also weren't just, we weren't getting the results that we were looking for. And also with a very small team, it was just a lot to manage. But since we've pivoted away from that into a subscription model, we've kind of eliminated the creator piece of it. So now instead of licensing courses, what we're doing is we're paying creators to create courses for us and then we own the content. So that's just simplified it because we don't have to maintain like a good looking creator portal. We don't need to maintain those parts of it. And the on-demand courses that you see on our site now are essentially the creators who were part of the first iteration. We've kept their courses on because they're great courses, but we aren't taking any more of those on-demand courses anymore. I was gonna ask actually, like if you, cause I noticed your subscription and you had kind of a dual model and those, you know, like the price ranges were vast in those and you can kind of correlate that to their other products or courses, you know, like they kind of maybe exist in some format and someplace else. And I was wondering with the subscription model, if you were paying royalties or how you work that, but it sounds like you're just, you're taking that as an upfront cost compensating and then you just run it so you're not having to deal with that complexity. Is that basically it? Kind of. So the on-demand side of it, people just, you can purchase those outside of the subscription. It's just whatever people pay upfront for it, we take the 25% and we hand over the rest to the creator. But for courses created within the subscription, all of those are things that we just, we own outright. So there is no commission part of it at all. That is very smart. We started and have a royalty based system to where we have a pool and we have to pay everybody out every month. And what I ended up building was an accounting platform. And I never in my life, never in my entire whole life, did I think I would be a developer on an accounting platform. But I've dug my own hole. So I live in it. Not the most exciting project. It's worked. I mean, it's interesting on a lot of levels, but it's really, it's a distraction to me at the end of the day and it just simplifies it. And we've been trying other models with kind of other properties. And at the end of the day, I think that's the simplest for everybody is just to not have ongoing monthly transactions kind of that sort of deal works out very well. What makes a really good course in your opinion? Oh, well, I mean, I think on like the most basic level, it has to do what it promises to do. Like if I think a lot of courses out there, they are not, they promise lots of intangible things. So I think the first thing is have a very tangible objective and then deliver on that objective. And there are courses that kind of make people, make the instructor look really smart and really good at what they do, but they kind of almost alienate the person taking it. So those are definitely bad courses. So a good course makes the learner feel like one, that they've been able to grasp something really quickly. They make them feel excited about what they're learning and then it gives them something that they can implement right away. So yeah. Yeah, like some outcome they're trying to achieve or they're able to accomplish something immediately from this. Yeah, 100%. Outside of your platform, what's a really good course that you've taken? Because you said you spent $20,000 on bad courses and I'm a course consumer as well. And I have some opinions and I've been, a lot of them are just like, wow, why are you even doing this? Like, it doesn't make sense to me. This shouldn't even exist. You're probably harming people. But I've taken some that have literally changed my life in like a profound way where it was like, just opened up completely new avenues. So what's a really good course that you've taken in the past? I mean, most of these are gonna be in the copywriting kind of space. Anything by Joanna Weave is fantastic. Oh yeah, like the copy hacker stuff. Yeah, copy hacker stuff. I mean, nothing else comes close to that. And she ticks every box when it comes to a great course. Christy Fenton created Brain Camp, which is fantastic. Something kind of a little bit outside of the copywriting space, a really good one is Linda Perry's Mindset Mastery. That was a really good one because I went through all of the imposter syndrome-y phases like the self-doubt, all of that. I started this business very young, had no experience whatsoever. So she helped me, that course in particularly really helped me break through a lot of those blocks. Get your- Yeah, my head's straight, yeah. Yeah, nice. Yeah. Yeah. For me, probably the biggest, the course that I've taken was Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman's 30 by 500, which is kind of a, it's a product development course. And I have this like strange fascination with the overlap of instructional design and product development and UX because I think like instructional design is very slept on. And the idea of how do you build something that people are going to actually, I feel like there's a, you know, like we jumped to marketing and kind of the solution end of the spectrum. But like, if you are building the wrong thing, that makes it really difficult. And I think I've read in some of your literature where that's one of the big parts of your business is the consultancy is helping people build something that people actually want and then actually delivering it. And you know, like that, that I think it's just critical because we often build the wrong things. And I think a lot of these, they get really well marketed or jumping into the solution and the marketing over the substance and the outcomes that they're actually achieving for their customers and learners is my experience. Yeah. I mean, I think most people can sell anything with a good marketing team behind it. And that's part of why there's so many crappy products out there. Um, should you be selling it is the real question. It's just like, and it's the same in the core space really. It's like people create courses because they're told it's a way to scale their business. And there are people who have no business creating courses, creating courses at this point. So yeah. Well, and you know, it's like people have expertise and we want to share that. And it is definitely marketable, but your expertise doesn't translate to instructional design or necessarily a course. What support do you provide now for course creators? Like when you come in and you start, like what's the process from like, here's an idea to the published product. Is this on the terrain side? Yeah, on terrain. Yeah. Usually it's kind of the other way around. We reach out to creators when we identify a topic that we're looking to have on terrain. And we've usually like vetted that this person is a real expert. We've looked at, I mean, there are times where I would go out and purchase another course of theirs just to see, make sure that they're the real deal. And then we set up an appointment with them. And the first step is really, if they're interested, they would send in an outline for the course. And since our courses are very specific and they're always in a how-to style, especially with the pivot to the subscription. And so it's almost like if this is working backwards, if somebody needs to achieve this desired end result, what steps do we need to go through and take them through to get them ready for it? And that's really what the outline looks like. So they need to decide the difficulty level, like is this for beginners, people with some experience, et cetera, the set objective. And once they have that outline done, they will work on putting together a script. And then the script is then reviewed by a panel of our peers. So these are people with varied experience, different industries, et cetera, just to make sure that one, we're checking for accuracy of information, but also clarity. There's so many times where like things that make sense to the expert may not necessarily make sense to everyone. There's a lot of that cursive knowledge stuff going on. So all of those kinds of things are looked for. And when that's ready, the creator can either produce the course themselves or it's handed over to our team and we'll handle production. We have a voiceover artist, we have decks and all of that created. And that's really it. What percentage of those do you think are, where the subject matter expert, the person that you've approached is the person that produces it versus having somebody else do the actual recording, I would say it's been a 50 50 split mostly because if they are marketers and they have their own business already, they opt to do it themselves. But if these are people that we're kind of approaching from more traditional industries, like there's one project that we're working on right now, we're speaking to an accountant and it's just, you know, understanding the numbers within your small business and they work at a local accounting firm. So they aren't really interested in getting, building a brand or building authority. They just have this deep expertise and they were happy to be compensated for their time. So. Like paid as a consultant or an expert at that point, right? Yeah. Do you think it matters? And I struggle with this. I'm always like, well, do we, you know, like, do we need somebody with, cause it does help to have somebody with an audience cause you obviously get some amplification, but at the end of the day, does it, does it really matter? We found that it hasn't. I think there's, I think that's one of like, one of our early value props was learn from the best, not the most famous. And it, as long as there is. That's a good one, I like that. Thank you. I'm rather proud of that one. So yeah, it doesn't really matter to us as long as they're an expert in there. So you talk about light bulb moments in courses and, and these, these, these things where we just like, it goes ta-da for us and we, we kind of see the light. What, what can we do as course creators or people helping to design courses to manufacture or encourage or, you know, otherwise present light bulb moments to learners? I think a big part of that is, and I'm, I'm really guilty of this. I know some of the early scripts that I wrote, I would just jump to the conclusion without showing my working and how I kind of arrived at that. I think it's really, really important to kind of walk people through your logic and your thinking so that they can then take that and be able to apply it in different contexts. And that's kind of where those moments come from. So showing your working examples also really helpful. And then the third part of it is I think asking questions and it sounds really, really simple, but I think just posing something as a question rather than kind of just straight up stating it as a fact can actually get people to engage with it a little bit more and encourages those light bulb moments. We, we have a, just a term that we use and it's essential questions where you have, you know, some question that doesn't, it isn't a yes or no question and it's something that you can debate or think about, but really like makes you kind of inspect what it is you're doing. And those, and I like them because they usually carry over across topics too. So like a truly essential question isn't going to be valid for one course. You're going to see this kind of repeated and come to come up over time. And when you're, you know, like if, especially when you're talking about something like entrepreneurial ventures or building a business, or, you know, like these topics that you're going into, there's a lot of core where it's all going to weave and it's like, oh, these things are all connected. It's a graph kind of situation, I think. For sure. So I wanted to kind of switch into the idea of marketing and the platform and the individual courses. And one of the things that I've heard you mention is this idea of being or creating lighthouse content, like things that you can do outside of the courses to like bring people in and attract visitors. And I would assume that means both learners and in some cases, even the course creators themselves. And I was wondering, what does lighthouse content mean and what kind of content are you creating that would serve as a lighthouse? I mean, I think this is a, this is an embarrassing question to answer a little bit because it's a cobbler's shoe kind of situation. Oh yeah. Yeah. You're not alone. I don't think you're unique in this. Yeah. It's something we help our clients do on this Cribesmith side. It's something that we have struggled to do on the Terrain side, just because we're a team that kind of tackles a lot of different, like every person is tackling lots of different parts of Terrain. So it's always like the marketing side it's embarrassing for a marketer to admit to this but it's always just been on the back, taking a backseat. But to answer your question, lighthouse content is anything that helps you kind of stand out and establishes that you have a perspective and an opinion. And it's unique. So like one of the challenges I think that a lot of people have with their marketing is that if you take their brand name off of it and slap somebody else's on, it'll sound and like nobody would really be able to tell. There is no distinctive message. There's nothing unique about it. And they don't really stand for anything. So I think having that and then being able to showcase that in different places, like being able to have a distinctive viewpoint when you're on a podcast, being able to have a distinctive viewpoint when you're in a webinar or even just with a blog post or in your emails, that's kind of where the idea of a lighthouse content comes from. It stands out. People can read something of yours and know immediately that it's yours. Yeah, it reflects your values and kind of actual opinions and not just kind of- The fluffy marketer talk. Yeah, the H1, this will change your life, right? Like it doesn't matter what the product is. It's just gonna be life-changing. Trust us, sign up. Yeah, basically. So one of the things that I've experienced and I assume most other people that are doing course platforms and particularly with subscription models is people will come in, they'll sign up, they'll learn what they need and then leave. And you mentioned the weekly challenges and keeping people engaged. And what's your go-to to prevent that churn and keep people to where they continue to get value out of the platform beyond what they originally signed up for? So we have an interesting strategy for this. We started implementing it and we haven't gone all the way yet. It's kind of a Q1 project, but what we're doing is we're incentivizing community participation by actually paying people to be there. So what we're doing is almost like a fractional revenue model. We take a percentage of what we have earned that month and we have something on the platform called peak points where people earn these points for completing courses, but also for interacting in our community, showing up for co-working, answering questions, asking helpful questions, things like that. And they earn points for this. So then we take all of the points earned in the month, divide them by that percentage, and then essentially you get the value of one peak point for that month. And then people are paid out for whatever they've earned that month. And what we're seeing is we haven't started paying people out yet, but we have started encouraging people to kind of start building those points, start kind of interacting in the community, et cetera. And we've seen that go up since we've kind of started introducing that model. We also do have a reward system where we give people NFTs for different things on the platform. Like we did NFTs for our lifetime members. We have stuff coming out for like most active in the community, those kinds of things. And yeah, and the fact that the payouts are in either USD or Bitcoin or Ethereum, that's definitely helped as well. So people feel like, I think anybody who's spending time in the community, they're creating value. And it's just, it's important to us that they're compensated for it. And for people who are really active in the community, it's totally possible that they will earn more than the $19 a month that they're paying for their subscription. So it's almost a no brainer. It will. And cause we talked earlier about paying royalties and now you're actually paying royalties, but you're paying royalties in a way that people wouldn't, it's kind of that, the, is it web three vibes? Is that what's going on? That's what's going on. Yeah, that's what's going on. Well, and I dig it. And I think like, it's one of the coolest things of that kind of community and that push is this idea that the consumers can also share in the profits of the overall enterprise. And that's pretty new, right? Like, I don't think that's something that we've ever seen before. And, you know, we have airdrops and people get NFTs. And like, in terms of other course platforms, like BuildSpace has been interesting to watch.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"watch what they do, and you complete a course and you get airdropped in NFT, and it's just fun. That part is fun, but then there's the idea of people creating DAOs out of it, too, and sharing in that and doing all that, which is more complex and kind of has that same spirit, but I think that's an interesting way. And I'm also, and I don't know, you might be interested in this, I think that people talk about blockchain not being useful, but I feel like education transcripts is one area where blockchain really makes a ton of sense to me. It's immutable, it's trusted sources, you can verify signatures back, and I'm like, wow, that actually is a use case that I'm thinking makes a ton of sense, frankly. Oh, 100%, yeah, I agree completely. I think education, any kind of online signing, like anything like HelloSign, DocuSign, those kinds of things, it's a no-brainer. Yeah, and to me, it just fits, and it takes a lot of friction out of it. And it's like, you don't need a fast database, it removes all those kind of complaints. And it's like, okay, well, why wouldn't we do that? Have you, I know you've talked about this, and Facebook ads and running ads across the internet, is that something you participated in with Terrain, or have you been able to avoid that? It was a part of our early strategy with our first iteration when we wanted to, when we had all the courses by 50 creators, all of that. It also happened just as iOS 14 launched. So yeah, Facebook ads were basically just a no-go for us at all. And it was a lot harder because at that point, we were selling 50 different courses by creators rather than one product, which is our membership. So it just, it didn't work out. We had terrible returns on that. It was just a bad idea. Where's the top of your funnel now? Like how are people finding Terrain? Honestly, it's just been word of mouth. And we do have, we have a free trial, and people have been signing up for that. But right now, we are in the process of a bunch, and we literally submitted it to the Google Chrome extension store this morning. We have a Chrome extension coming out that lets people who are watching YouTube videos, pull the YouTube video onto, like onto Terrain's learning interface, and take notes and create action items, et cetera. And this came out, one, because I was, I got really used to our interface, and it was great to be able to take notes and stuff while I was watching YouTube videos. But then we heard that complaint come up over and over again from people who were using Terrain, and they're just like, this is a great interface. I wish I could use it for other kinds of content. And we're experimenting now with using that as our top of funnel. Because it's free, and it gets people into our ecosystem, gets people used to our interface. And then we also are able to promote relevant content based on the kinds of YouTube videos they're watching. I take it that's probably not a no-code project. No, that wasn't. No, that wasn't. Is that something you commissioned, and had somebody build for you? Or is that something that you built in-house? It's something that I taught myself to build after like 35 million YouTube videos. It was definitely a challenge. It's taken me, I'm sure it would have taken, yeah, I'm sure it would have taken someone with more knowledge a couple of hours, but it took me a couple of months. But I'm really proud of it. And it's partially on no-code. I mean, when it pushes people over to Terrain, I mean, that part is obviously on no-code, but like the extension part. So just in that same lines, I've been, have you ever seen Frame.io? I'm just talking about tools now that I've liked lately. Have you seen Frame.io? It's the video editing tool, isn't it? Well, it's more like a video, it's like an interactive video review tool is how I would maybe describe it. It's been, I spent the last year like rebuilding our video player. Add this to like integrate notes and stuff because one of the things that I think is missing and I hope they're not listening, but I really don't like Teachable. And like every time I have to like, I'll watch a course there and it's fine, but it's like one of my least favorite experiences because as you mentioned earlier, it's like, okay, well, I have 12 videos. I'm gonna slap them up there and then I'm done. I got a course. And like you're left in this situation where I have a video on one screen and I'm trying to take notes. Like actually, literally I have a system where I go through and rip all of the videos and move them into a system I can actually stand. And like a lot of times I actually move them into to where I can then take notes and like it has hotkeys and I'm just taking notes. I just wanna transcribe it. I want my notes and I wanna like, I wanna be in my learning environment and I wanna stay there. And I don't wanna have to jump around to do all the things I need to do. And I know that's important. And what other kind of aspects have you added to your platform that they kind of speak to this idea of staying inside of what you're learning without having to jump all around windows? We try and keep it as distraction-free as possible. So you can't, like it's not, the next lessons and stuff are not immediately visible. You have to like toggle to actually see it. Notes are actually on the side. You don't have to scroll away from the darn video to actually take notes. It used to drive me nuts because every single platform has notes under the video and it's stupid. Like they didn't think that through. Searchable transcripts and like transcripts that let you jump to specific points in the video. Again, no brainer stuff that you just don't see on a lot of these platforms. One thing that I really like that we have is the ability to create action items from within that learning view. So you can, and we've been working on the integration for this. It's just, it's coming, but you will be able to integrate it with your Asana, your Trello, whatever. So as soon as you create an action item on terrain, it gets added to your project management tool as well. So yeah. So those are kind of little things that we have in place, but yeah. Have you like balanced your, cause you have Scribesmiths, so you have an agency and you're building a learning platform and has that balance shifted over time or do you split your time or how does that work for you? This is, this also assumes that I have balance in a life outside of work. I don't, so I understand. Oh man. I work, I work. What are you talking about? I work, exactly. I work some more. No, it's, I think for the last two years, especially since like, ever since we had the idea for terrain, it's the balance has definitely shifted. I'm very fortunate that Scribesmith is mostly in a place where it runs like clockwork, no real trouble there, a phenomenal team. They handle most of it. So if it wasn't for terrain, I think I would have phenomenal work-life balance. I would have more life than work, which would be great, but yeah. You wouldn't have spent the last two months building a Chrome extension. This is true. I mean, I probably would have still done it because it was so much fun, but yeah. It's a fun time. Yeah. I love it. I call, I mean, I have hobbies and they're all leisure work. That's what my term for it is, leisure work. And not, you know, like I actually, like I think people should find whatever balance they need and you know, whatever is good for you. And like, I function that way and I just like, kind of enjoy it. It is, I don't know if it's relaxing. It's just like, it's what I do and what I like to do. It's stimulating, yeah. So I keep doing it and you know, like there's, everybody should achieve whatever balance they can for themselves, I guess. My last question is, what's your most audacious goal for Terrain? Oh man, I haven't said this out loud to anyone yet. So I started my business while I was based in Qatar and that came with its own set of challenges, just like building outside of North America, lack of legitimacy, all of those kinds of things. And I know so many people in other parts of the world who are struggling to kind of get their businesses off the ground. My goal, my big ridiculous goal for Terrain is to someday get to a point where we have helped 1,000 people from outside of North America build businesses that are getting them at least 50 grand a year. And that would be the dream, yeah. I think that's great and I love that and I know that that speaks to your values and that part of what Terrain does now is give back to entrepreneurs around the world. So you're not, that isn't a future goal, you're actively working on this goal, correct? Yeah, we are, we are. We're nowhere near it, but someday. No, but just putting it up there and setting it as a milestone. I think you'll get there. Just sort of everything I've seen and talking to you and listening to you and interacting with your platform and seeing kind of the quality work that you produce and the values that you're putting out there, I think you're gonna get there. Like that's how I feel about it if I was making a prediction, so. Thank you, that means so much, thank you. Iman, it was really fantastic to talk to you. I feel like we could talk for a long time because we have a lot of crossover in our interests and what we do and what we like to do for leisure work. But for now, I'm gonna call it a day and I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me. Thank you, thank you so much for having me. This was great. Cheers.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Hey Brennan. Hey. What's up Joel? Pretty stoked to talk to you today. We've worked together. I'm like an aficionado of your courses in particular and I send a lot of people to them because they've radically changed how I think and operate and do business and I think that's fantastic because I don't know that there's a lot of courses out there that you can say that about. But before we dig into all that, I want to ask you how you personally approach complex subject or something that you want to learn. I'm super novice and when I've been going about learning Vue, my approach with that which is pretty for me across the board is just to do the basic bare minimum learning through whether it be videos on YouTube or written blog posts or whatever else but also to jump in head first and break stuff. So I'm very much like I have friends who will do a crap ton of academic learning up front before they even dive in head first whether it be new technology or new subject or something like that. But I'm very much personally very driven by cause and effect. So can I learn just bare minimum, try something out like a hello world, see it in action, see how it works and then iterate on that with more educational material and then apply and more and apply and so on and so forth. So I don't know if that answers your question, but I'm very much a let's break things quickly kind of guy. I've seen you've been recently in the wood shop too, which I think is a similar kind of experience, right? You just go out there and start sawing and measuring and cutting and building. Yeah. And with the stuff coming out of it, it's shit. Like I'm doing a playhouse in the backyard right now. And yeah, I mean, I've learned the hard way the importance of what all these YouTube videos I saw and the importance of squaring is with if it's not square then you're just going to have like weird off cuts of your decking boards and stuff like that. So yeah, I mean I, that's how I thrive. I think I do better like screwing up a lot and then learning that way versus somebody telling me, don't be aware of this, don't do this otherwise, whatever. Like finding the pitfalls yourself instead of having them all pointed out to you in a tidy roadmap. And I'm just impatient. I mean, I just like to, I couldn't imagine like sitting through too much training on woodworking before I actually got out there with a saw and a chisel and did stuff. Yeah. So, I mean, in that respect, you probably wouldn't watch one of your own courses. You would just do the work and then yeah, I mean, yeah, because I would probably like if I were, if I came across my own stuff, to be honest, I would probably pass on it for a bit in favor of just going in and trying weird shit until something works. But that being said, I have more recently, I did invest in a proper to go back to the woodworking theme and a proper comprehensive course. Now that I've got that itch of like discovery out of me, I'm now willing to dive deeper into learning from people who have obviously been doing this for a long time. So I would say like, at first I like to jump in head first and cut myself a few times, but then I'll go through the proper stuff. Once I think, once I see that, okay, I do enjoy this, I do want to continue down this path. Then and only then will I usually then jump into something with a bit more rigor, if that makes sense. Yeah. Woodworking is tough because you end up with all the tools too. Like I have, I own a table saw. I don't use a table saw, but I have a table saw. And that was like my own adventure into woodworking. I'm like, oh, I need a table saw. I took a class and we used one and I was like, oh, I definitely need that. Then you end up with a table saw and then what are you going to do with that? The digital stuff where it's a lot easier to less takes up a lot less space in the garage. But tools are fun. So. Well, and every time I hear the table saw spin up because somebody needs a table saw in my house, I get so excited. I'm like, oh yeah, the table saw is getting used. It's so fast and efficient. We can cut wood. Nobody's business. You've got to have the tools to do the thing, but it's always that trap of tools, right? Like you can't buy cameras and become a better photographer. You have to take pictures to become a better photographer. And it's the same is true for like web development or building things with wood or whatever. To actually do the thing is how you become good at it. And that is, to be honest, to go back to that earlier, that first question you posed to me, one problem I definitely do have is I try to get to mastery ASAP, I think. So I went out and bought probably every imaginable woodworking tool that I'd need ever upfront. And then just started playing with them all and doing stuff with them rather than what I should have done, which is only acquire new tooling when you have something, a project on hand that needs the tool. But I don't like to, I don't like to be at that amateur's phase or stage too long. I like to, I mean, you can see what the pros use. So why not just jump right to it? Yeah, exactly. I'm the same way. We won't talk about synthesizers. So when you, if you're evaluating a course or creating your own course, what goes into it? What makes a really good course in your opinion? I mean, I think for me, I've, I think I've produced meh courses, but also really good ones. And I find that the really good ones tend to be things that I'm really confident at and teaching. So case in point with the, probably the one that I've done that, that has had the most kind of effect in terms of the people going through it, writing to me saying, this has been monumental for me. That'd probably be like mastering ConvertKit at this point. And where that came from was really having done a V1 of that course titled Mastering Drip before I ditched Drip. And then before that was doing a ton of individualized consulting work and own and personal experimentation. But I think most importantly, consulting work where I was actually hired by a few companies to come in and do some of that work, but also more importantly, relay it onto their marketing team to show them like what's going on and why is this useful and how do you do it and so on. So that act of needing to communicate what I wanted to, what I knew internally to someone, somebody else again and again, made it so when I went into the cave and hit record, I think I was much better equipped to do that because otherwise I think the products that have done worse for me in terms of like success rates have been the ones where I might know some subject fairly well, but my ability to translate what I know to help somebody with who wants that knowledge, ability to transfer that knowledge is pretty subpar. So for me, I found that the things that I've done best with have been things that I've iterated on with previous versions of that course or done, whether it be live group workshops or individual consulting and just done it again and again. Like I think you, if you remember my consultancy masterclass from like nine years ago now or something. Yeah. I did. It changed my life. Yeah. And I did like that. I did that 15 times, I think. It was a two day, all day workshop, do that 15 times. And I mean, frankly, the 15th class got the best version of the class, right? You keep doing it better and better each time because you get to learn what am I saying? What am I teaching that is falling on deaf ears? What is being challenged? Where are people still confused at the end of it? And then you can just use that to better teach it in the future. So I think mistake wise, whenever I've gone first into recording, say a video course without doing that live discussion based component multiple times, those courses, those products always tend to not be nearly as effective. And I end up probably redoing them after learning that. Yeah. And I think it's interesting because to me, consulting is the format of teaching, right? Like you're doing and you're implementing, but it's a format. And then you go to instructor led workshops and maybe cohort based courses. And finally you get to like a book and a self-paced course and that sort of thing. But it's not drawn from, you're not doing research on the internet and then creating a course really. You are like, you have to iterate. And between those, between consulting and workshops and self-paced courses, it feels like there's trade-offs. And what's the trade-off that you're getting between a live workshop and like a self-paced course? Well, you can't talk back to a self-paced course, right? I mean, maybe you can through like a community group or something. But it's not as, the thing I keep thinking about that I was actually thinking about, I did a live workshop two weekends ago and I mentioned this, so I don't know if you remember that thing Patrick McKenzie said once where a lot of his consulting gigs were basically dramatic readings of blog posts he's written already. And that's so true, I think with context, right? Yeah, exactly. Applied, his 10,000 word blog post applied specifically to this company's situation where if the recommendations, the prescriptions are all still the same, but examples might be different and the language might differ and so on and so forth. And I think that's something that, I used to write that off as how important really is that? Why not just go straight to like, why pay for the dramatic recital of Patrick's blog posts when you could just read the blog post? But I do think now, especially since I've done many of these workshops, that it is more important than I initially thought to feel as you're receiving the information that the examples resonate with you and that the references are meaningful to you and that the language being used applies to. It's that whole, that worldview thing that I know Amy talks a lot about. I never really internalized, I guess, how important it was for that. And I think that's frankly, for me, one of the biggest benefits, whether it be hiring a consultant or doing a live discussion-based workshop is the ability to have that student context be incorporated into the teaching itself. So when you're teaching that and you're dealing with students and you're hearing their context or you're dealing with consulting clients and you're enmeshed in their context as well, at some point you probably get to the tipping point where you've heard enough and can see the similarities or have divided it down into, it's these four things generally. And are you learning the teachable moments as well and through this experience, figuring it out as you develop, do you start thinking self-paced course is eventually going to come from this? Or is it more like an experimentation and evolution through the process? I think lately I've been thinking that self-paced course. So the workshop I did two weekends ago, when I sold it, I basically made it very clear that I do want to turn this into a self-paced course eventually, but I want to have the students in the first few iterations of it be the guinea pigs that I need to figure out what to teach in that self-paced course. And I also actually made it a bit of a two for one saying when it does become a self-paced course, you'll get it free. So not only do you get the course eventually, but you're going to help me by getting something more valuable than you will out of a self-paced course, because you're going to get your specific needs addressed and so on, rather than needing to watch some sort of monologue that is very intentionally designed to apply to probably a large swath of people, which is the underlying requirement I think of a prerecorded course where it is a monologue. It's me to them, me to the, whoever happens to be watching this. And that necessitates me generally, unless it's super niched to be intentionally broad about certain things and not dig into specifics or anything like that. Whereas with a live workshop, I can have somebody pipe up and say, Hey, here's my unique situation. How does what you're saying apply to this? And that's why I think as a student, live workshops are a lot more valuable than prerecorded. Yeah. I'm always on the fence because I love live workshops, but then I feel like it fades where and Master and Convert Kit is interesting to me as a, just an example, because I've used it so much and I've gone through, I was a consultancy client of yours. And I remember drip.js from, I think it's still in my code base and I've seen the evolution of it. And it's interesting because I returned to it and I'm like, I go back and I go back in different phases. Like I come back to the material because I'm like, it's always like you have to build and I'm able to return to it where some of the workshops I've been to, it feels like I go and I do it. And then maybe I have some notes or my little project that I did, but I'm left in kind of a lurch. So it's always, there's, that's one of the trade-offs that I think, Grant, like I can revisit this and get my own pace, like spiral back through this content or learning stuff, re-approach exercises, that sort of thing that I can't do in a live scenario. So it's really, I mean, there's benefits to both formats in my opinion. Well, I think to extend on that, the one thing I tried to do with this, the latest workshop I did, I developed it right after reading Rob Fitzpatrick's book on, yeah, on live workshops. And the thing that I think I made the mistake of early on was treating a live workshop as a live video course, effectively, right? Where it's just me doing my monologue. Because he's got that flow, I suggest. So what I did was I did the, like a 10 minute, very short introductory lesson, really just to ground us all on, so we're on the same page and speaking the same language and then got into discussion and then got into a, what I call the action part where it was more of, I want to make sure by the end of the workshop, you're walking away with a Google doc of all these bullet points that are going to get you going. And then what I'm doing now is I'm following up over the span of about two months with additional material and additional context that relates to that. So like the idea is, what can you get from a live event like that, that you can't get from a prerecorded video course. With that, I can, as the host, the facilitator, I can encourage you and make sure that by the end of it, you walk away with this Google doc of like action items, of to-do tasks. But you need to know how to execute on the to-do. So my thinking is what I'm doing now is I'm sending out like, it's simple, it's a little loom videos. Okay. So in the first learning module, we talk about X, Y, and Z. You have in your task list for that module stuff, and here's some videos on how to implement and execute on the high level things that you outlined in that doc. So I didn't show them, we've sticked, it was like with roadmapping where we stuck to high level outcome-based stuff during the workshop, didn't get into any of the technical weeds. But now what I'm doing is I'm drip out, dripping out material that is helping them technically execute on the big picture directional stuff that we focused on during the live event. Because I think where it'd be no sense in me getting on like a live Zoom call and sharing my screen and like walking through arcane technical convert kit stuff. Doesn't make sense. It's better off as a video. But for the discussion, like probing kind of stuff, I find a live event so much better for that. So I wanted to really make it so if this is going to be a live event, let's actually make it, let's leverage the uniqueness that we get from something live, which meant ignoring entirely technical execution, all that kind of stuff. So I've done a lot of workshops in my life and Rob Fitzpatrick's, the workshop survival guide is the name of the book that you mentioned has, was like, it's one of the most succinct and interesting. And his book that follows that is, is write useful books. And I'm like, and then he has the mom test. And as a sequence, the mom test workshop, survival guide and write useful books is like the best primer of practical implementation of like, I'm an expert. I'm going to, you know, like see people's problems. I'm going to teach them live and then I'm going to codify it. And he stops at useful books and I'm like, I read, I don't know if you've read the right useful books. I have. Yeah. To me, it's, you could say great courses and just replace the title. And really, if you think about the value proposition of books versus courses to me, like he's written just absolutely like the basic, get in and understand and start doing this. And it's like on our recommended list, if I was making a box set, that's, and then Amy Hoy's just fucking ship is in there as well. Yep. Just as like, here's the, the, the set and you can go and you can teach, but his workshop survival guide is, is great in that it's, you know, not just lecture, it's multimodal and you're switching back and forth between, you know, showing, doing and telling. And I really enjoyed it. And I think that's the thing, like you can't, you can't do that with something prerecorded. You can't get that depth of multimodal anything. And I think that's why I really wanted to say when I do this workshop that I really want to use really frankly, selfishly to pioneer the eventual video course, because I don't like having things on my calendar that I need to go to. So I'd much rather replace it with something that people could just buy on their own. I, yeah, I wanted to just, I wanted to make sure that I do this right. It'll be truly discussion-based and truly a true dialogue where I'm learning just as much as they're learning. And then, so we, the host and the attendee gets equal value out of the event, and then I can then use what I learn to then create the right video course, not just a video course. So I think that's a big thing that I think I've been trying to think about a lot lately, which is the distinction between successfully making a video course or something with like X many lessons and blah, blah, blah, versus the right video course, where it actually succeeds in the, in the fullest sense of the word at solving the problem that led somebody to buy it. Yeah. At the end of the day, like if the course isn't making that difference in the learner's lives, right? That's the success is that it's actually effective. And then you get the financial success and there's other outcomes that are important to you. But like at the end of the day, the course itself has to be effective and successful for the people that are taking it for it. And let's face it, if it's more successful, there'll be more word of mouth referrals. And it's just, it's good for, it's good for everyone when that happens. So yeah, people are succeeding. They talk about it. Right. And I'm, I'm not waving a flag for mastering convert kit, not because of the affiliate program, which I appreciate, but I'm waving the flag because it's really been effective for me. And I think people should watch it because they learn a lot. And, and I'm going to go out and do that. And the more successful you are with a book or a course, then the more you're likely to share it. And that's really the best, I think at the end of the day, that's, that's the best marketing you can get is people having success with your product. Do, so there's a lot of off the shelf kind of course platforms out there. And I was throwing the air quotes around my, my, and, and I don't want to drag them too hard, but do they encourage successful courses from the learner's perspective? I guess what my real question is like, why? Cause you've built your own course platform now over the last year and a half or so you've actually left kind of these generic course platforms and built your own. And why would you do that? And like, why wouldn't you just use something off the shelf? Let me answer that first question that you had about to the, to the hosted platforms help deliver actual good courses. I think they, they attempt to in their content marketing. I think you go to blog or podiums blog. I'm sure there are articles on like how to develop great courses and stuff like that. Yeah. But I do think that with the, with, I mean, you, you and I are both rails people. So I don't know if this will make sense to everyone else, but it does seem like most courseware platforms tend to really just go down the scaffolding route for everything of like, I scaffold out a lesson and I can create lessons. I can update lessons. I can retrieve and delete them. And what I'm getting at is they're very much like placeholdery. Like you got a lesson as a title. Lesson might have a video attached. Lesson might have this, you click save, you reorder it, you file them neatly under modules and so on and so forth. And I mean, technically, yeah. If you want to look at like a features page that that ticks the box of what a courseware platform is expected to do. But I do think though that at the end of the day, these are simply tools and tools can be used correctly or incorrectly. And it's, I would question like what job does ConvertKit have in helping people send really good emails. And I think that's difficult as a software company to be really good at educating and really good at delivering good tools too. It behooves them to try, but that's not really what they're there for. I think they tend to try through like lead generating blog posts, if that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. Like general content marketing, right? It's not built in and integrated into the product itself. It's just like a blog post about five things that you should do in your course or something. I think it's unfortunate because I think like you, it'd be interesting to see how can the platform itself be less crud-like or less scaffold and more something that's more, I can't imagine what the UX would be like, but something like let's define first what we want the outcome to be for your students and then helping you work backward and lay out the right lessons and lay out the right material and so on. So I don't know. I don't know if any platform has done that or has attempted to do anything like that outside of like basic first-time onboarding or blog posts or whatever else. Where you get an email sequence or they're like, go read this blog post. This is like, you should read this or study this, but the platform doesn't really drive It's not built into the platform and into how it's designed. It would probably annoy people, honestly, and be like less mass market. If you're like, oh, you're going to have to do this stuff before you can make your course. People are gonna be like, I recorded all these videos already. So can I just post them please? Yeah, exactly. But to answer your question about why I'm not just using a hosted platform, I built my own and the reason I built my own is there's the user experience angle and there's also the, I want to make money angle for reasons why I did it. I'll start with the money one. I've always subscribed, I think, to the multi-tiered way of thinking about products. The Delkian approach. The Delkian approach. What was it? 1x, 2.2x, 5x or something insane. But yeah, if you remember back, like all of us 10 years ago, we were doing the like ebook videos, full package, three pricing thing. I'm still doing that. But the issue I've always had is that whole saying it's easier to sell more to existing customers and why? Like why? I haven't seen any courseware platform that makes it easy to say like, here, add your basic content and then tease the premium content, but gray it out if they don't own that package. And then if they click it, maybe have a big like one click upgrade button thing or something. I wanted that kind of functionality and I just couldn't see how to do that with any of the platforms I looked at. And I wanted to be able to do things like if somebody shares a public lesson, maybe do something like, I did this with W Freelancing where they were mostly text courses, but I would have the first 200 words visible and then I'd have a little grading overlay and it would fade out with them, have a upsell or buy now join the course, unlock content called action. So I wanted stuff like that. I wanted to be able to do things like that. I wanted to integrate things like, let's say I eventually want to attach like a product of one-off transactional product to a lesson. I'm supposed to say it's a lesson on something about liquid. And I come up with a something that's outside of the course, maybe like the temple pack I did. And I want to promote that somehow. I wanted to eventually be able to do that nicely. And I just, it seemed like the way that all these courseware platforms were set up is you'd have a storefront and then you'd buy a course and then you'd have like your dashboard of courses you have access to, but there wasn't any like intercourse relating stuff, which is what I wanted. So I, even though I I'm not fully there yet, I'm starting to work toward that with the create and sell stuff I'm doing now. I wanted to be able to eventually be there. So that was one of, that's probably the selfish money-making reason I rolled my own. From the UX perspective though, I always thought it was weird. I won't name names, but like certain platforms would, would do things like make it so you can't easily have resources attached to lessons. And my lessons are usually very long video lessons. And I wanted to have like a associated Google.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"block like that you could then duplicate and mess with or this or that. And it was always awkward to do that both from like me as the, you know, course creator going and actually setting it up, but also as the student, like seeing that. And I wanted to do little things. If I have a 45 minute long video, which I know like a lot of people, my, the biggest complaint people have is that my videos aren't two to three minutes or something. Um, I agree. Cause I actually, I can't, I, I, I hate going through a video course that is in these small little chunks, especially if I'm casting it to my TV, because then it just throws off Chromecast and it just never works, but mine are long. Many of my lessons are long, but I wanted to be able to leverage, I'm using Wistia as the video host and I wanted to leverage their chapters. So I just built onto my coursework, you know, platform recently, the ability to have a chapter list within a lesson. So you can just click and it would jump directly to it and stuff along with highlighting transcript stuff. So I had the transcript for every lesson now, and I want it to be able to add this subtitles, but also give you a nice transcript that you could either read on the page or download is I, it's just, I couldn't find a platform that ticked all the boxes, both from the sales perspective. Um, and what I just mentioned, the UX perspective, I just. Didn't see anything I liked. So I did the thing that probably wasn't, isn't the right business move to make. And dedicated time and risk bug exposure to roll my own thing from scratch. I feel like just from a purely business perspective, like long-term, if you're talking long games, right, like, and you're thinking about it, this is what I'm doing, this is my job, this is what I do, it makes it, it makes a ton of sense to me, but it's not, and you, I think the, your progression, right. Cause you use the off the rack stuff and then it progressed to this because it didn't meet your needs. Like that makes a lot of sense to me. In particular about the UX, because if like you're seeing your students need a certain experience and you're not able to deliver that also, I imagine, I can't imagine how frustrated it is from your, as a, like an expert marketer and like personalization and segmentation and all that fun stuff that you do and just not being able to, has to be incredibly frustrating. Yeah. I mean, it's just, it all seems, I hate to say it, but it seems like a lot of these tools were designed by developers. I was just looking at a really big one the other day and I was looking at a sales page or something. And the call to action you could tell was there was an if else of like either access the course or a button that says you don't have access to a buy it. And the button that, cause I obviously didn't buy the course. I wasn't logged into anything. Was that else that, that said you don't have access to buy it, but they were speaking to me as if I was a logged in user who didn't currently have access to the product rather than something. I think that could have been more effective to get me to as somebody who is not authenticated, not a customer of anything, get me to be, don't make it just so I don't know if what I'm saying is making sense, but it was just very much like you could tell it was a literal if else that the button copies the same. If you're logged in and bought something else, but didn't buy that it's the same copy for them as it would be for somebody who is totally unknown and hasn't bought anything and just a little stuff like that, that I would as a marketer, I'd be like, ah, there's some copy differences. I'd probably want to include show one, one set of copy to somebody who's already a customer, but not a customer of that versus somebody who's not a customer at all in programming lingo, you would have a switch statement versus an if else statement, right? It would be a nice. A BFE switch. Probably get away with it. Else that might work too, but yeah, flip it on its head, but like more options and just, it's just, it's the little things, it's the details at the end of the day, and I think that a lot of times if I'm just going to get something out there and push it, and I think people are in that disappointed also, because they'll think about it. I'm going to create this course. People tell me I should, I'm an expert. I'm going to record the videos. I'm going to post the videos and then they land on crickets. And this is why, to me, most, almost everything I see out there is, is really focused on the, the marketing, right? Like marketing will fix your problems. And I sometimes think that's maybe not the approach that like marketing isn't, it's important, but like the stuff we were talking about earlier, where you're developing and you're consulting and you're working with students and you're doing the live stuff and you're, you're iterating and developing over time. And then you're posting it online for people to go, you'll like, it ends up marketing itself, like we were talking about, right? With the word of mouth versus just creating something and then you get nothing. Why aren't people buying my videos? It's because they don't understand it or it doesn't feel like it's for them or that sort of thing. So you've been able to go in and create a platform that accomplishes both from a marketing perspective and a delivery perspective, and you can iterate on it and it'll fit the structure of any future courses that you might want to put out there and you can change it up. Yeah. You do everything yourself, like technically. I do. Is that challenging? What's your tech stack currently? How, how did you build, create and sell? So I built, so historically I'm a, I'm a Ruby guy, right? So rails is my thing I've been using for many years, but I haven't touched it. Haven't kept on top of, or haven't really done anything with Ruby and I haven't looked at any new stuff in rails for probably five or six years because before, or the last time I really touched rails was with planscope, which is a SaaS site I used to have. And then I moved on to W freelancing, which is just a WordPress site. So I moved off of needing Ruby, but I'm actually, so the create and sell stack is a Statamic, which I only use because I thought the site was nice. And I think like Justin Jackson or somebody tweeted it and I looked at it and I was like, Oh, this looks like a nice CMS and it was built off of Laravel, which I'd heard things about. So yeah, it's a built on Statamic, which is really a layer, a CMS layer on top of Laravel. Is it, you said you're using view. Are you doing like the full front end or is it all just templated and related to the framework that you're using? No, I'm using it. So I'm not using view for this. I'm actually using, cause there's not a lot of JavaScript on the, in the course for itself, so I'm using Alpine JS to do all that, which gives me view stuff with, kind of reminds me of a little bit like jQuery or something, maybe less robust where you get just a little bit of interactivity, but it's lightweight and you're not sending a bunch of JavaScript to the client. So yeah, you're not taking a bunch of like event listeners or anything like that. You're just adding to dom nodes, like when this gets clicked, do this or whatever. So I'm using Alpine JS for things like toggling lesson completion stuff and making it so like when you click a chapter, it'll then tell Wistia's JavaScript API to jump to this chapter or whatever in the viewer, in the, in the player, there's not a lot, not a ton of JavaScript going on the front end client side, there's some other stuff too. Like I'm using, I know you have thoughts on this, but I'm using paddle selling stuff because I, now that I'm in Europe, I think VAT collection is a nightmare and Stripe still doesn't make it easy. I just didn't want to think about any of that stuff. So I went with paddle and so I'm needing to do stuff like that. Because if you think about technically, if I'm selling a course, I've got a Statamix CML page and ended up building my own, like it's effectively like a repeater, if you've used advanced custom fields with WordPress or anything like that, where I can add like the testimonial block and I can add a CTA block and I can add a comparison or a right for you, not right for you block and all these different things, and then just, it'll then be fed into the CMS and then spit out the compiled HTML. So every course has a sales page that I host, and then you click the buy button and it prompts a little paddle pop-up. And then there is also like the webhook stuff. So when paddle, when somebody buys, I had to have a controller that is a larval controller that when they buy gets all that information and then finds or finds or creates their user in Statamix. So we can log in and access the course, adds them to the thing. And also phones over to ConvertKit and segments them the right way. So I had to roll all that for, to make it work. So it's not just the course where it's also the like sales page, the purchase flow and everything in between. How do you balance the content creation, like actually creating the courses and then working on the platform itself? Cause they're really two different, two totally different products in mind. I don't actively tend to the platform. I mean, it's really, if I'm adding a new feature to like when I added the chapter stuff, I mean, I just spent a day or something in that, but it's not some, I'm not like dedicating X many hours a week or anything to the platform. It's just, it works and it's there. And I read it once. And then when I need to add new content, it's just a matter of going into Statamix CMS backend and going to the course and adding content or changing stuff or whatever else. And I've built it in such a way where like when I'm adding, say I'm adding a new lesson, it's, and this is where it's similar to a hosted thing. I type in the knit title of the lesson. I give it the Wistia ID for embedding. I give it length since I didn't, I could have coded something that would query Wistia and say, how long is this video? But I didn't bother writing that. So I manually enter in how long the video has changed. So, yeah, exactly. And, but if I was doing a platform teachable or something, yeah, I would write that and not make people need it. I think there's like this idea, cause you've built a personal platform and you are currently the sole creator, but then there's like the platform as a platform, as a service, and then there is like the marketplace, right? Like Gumroad or something where they're providing like the, the bazaar where you can browse and go through. So there's like different layers. And I think personally, from my experience, create something for yourself where you're the only user is much, much simpler than creating a marketplace for infinity users. That, I think is one of my frustrations too, with the hosted stuff is like they try to do, they're all trying to be kitchen sinks and they're all trying to come up with their own sales page builder thing, along with they want to capture payments and this and that. Do you even do email? I much prefer, I just want my sales page to be a normal webpage that I, I, I don't want to be constrained into your things. Cause I've seen a lot of the sales pages that these hosted platforms have. And they're also like, you can tell they're all the same template. They're not very, in my mind, they're not really always that optimized for actual for sales, it's like title, short description, and then like a table of lessons or something. And I guess you can do other stuff probably, but it just seems like a lot of the courses I see, it's just very much like, it's not the Amy Hoy 30 by 500 style sales page that I think you and I favor. It's just dream fix. Yeah, exactly. It's just, it's very featured a feature. Like these are the features of this product kind of thing. These are the module, this is the module hierarchy. These are the lessons under each module and stuff you shall get. Yeah, exactly. So I just, I would much rather just say like a sales page, it's just a webpage. I'm going to develop it. I'm going to find out how to capture money from people and then. Yeah, so I think if I were to use a hosted one, I would basically just use it simply for the hosting part, ideally for delivery, yeah, for the delivery of fulfillment and not basically ignore everything else. What's your most audacious goal with create and sell or your courses in general? Do you have anything like a long-term audacious goal that you have in your mind? Well, the only thing with create and sell it's, it's interesting. Cause when I, so I started last February, February of 2021, and it was really just a place for me to rant about stuff that wouldn't be appropriate to rant about under the right message block. I started writing that stuff and they're really the only product I really could put because mastering drip master and convert kit were all technically housed under wfreelancing.com, which made no sense because most of the people buying it, weren't buying it to better their freelancing, you'd have software shops buying it or something like that, or creators or whatever. I just thought, okay, I'll start a website. I'll send out a weekly newsletter and I'll move over this thing from w freelancing to it. So that's where it started. The problem is it's a very expensive and premium course. And it's very specific to an advanced level thing to do with one software product, right? So what I'm doing now is I'm trying to fill in the gaps and think what are other products that can create the product funnel that lead to something like mastering convert kit. So that's what I'm working on now. Hence like that workshop that the workshop I referenced earlier, which was really a beginning marketing workshop, which is something I've never done before. I'd never done anything on like how to start doing email marketing from scratch the right way. You wouldn't jump in headfirst in a course like mastering convert kit. If you were just started sending your first email or whatever. You could, it's going to be, I'm not seeing people try, but it's like a lot of information to absorb. So I'm just trying to think of, I'm trying to be maybe more modular or not modular is the wrong word, but more like mastering convert kits, a big product, and I'm now thinking of, Oh, wouldn't it be fun to do like a West boss style, like a liquid for marketers type thing where it's just like a proper thing on all the stuff you can do and the limitations of liquid, but not targeting devs, but treating it like, like a learning to code course, but the coding language happens to be liquid. Yeah. So that's something I'm going to, I'm going to probably do at some point soon. And it's like little things like that. That won't be like a massive 20 hour course, like mastering convert kit. It'll instead be like a shorter primer on, Hey, if you're not a coder, but you want to do more than like sticking somebody's first name in, here's what you can do and here's how, and here's how you go about learning how to code by making your emails a little more dynamic. Do you consider adding other, other experts into create and sell or just mostly going to focus on Brandon? I think I'd like to, but I just don't know how to be honest. Does that make sense? I'm not sure from the partnership level, how to do all that stuff. And from like the, then I need to figure out like, how do I trust that they'll do what I need them to do rightly and based on how we do it, I mean, it adds a ton of complexity, right? If you're doing it, I mean, you can mostly trust yourself and then the quality levels and then that'll meet your goals and all that fun stuff. But as soon as you bring anybody else into the mix, partners are, partners are hard, right? Like, yeah, exactly. So I think like, I wouldn't be opposed to it, but I, and especially if I ever, one of the interesting things I'm doing now is I'm capturing what ESP somebody uses when they sign up. So email service provider and convert kits 30%, but I'm getting a lot of like active campaign and stuff. And I don't know anything about active campaign. So would it make sense for me to partner with somebody who does know something about active campaign and do like a mastering active campaign? Probably, but I just don't, I don't know if I have the energy to do that, to be honest. And it's almost a little bit of management at that point, right? Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, but I wouldn't write it off, but I just haven't put much thought to it. Brandon, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me and I like can't express my, my gratitude enough in terms of, of how your courses and your just willingness to share and, and let people explore and even sometimes piggyback off of, of your work. And I think it's just generous and I love the spirit and, and I look forward to seeing what you do next. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks Joel.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I'm excited to talk to you, you've been building a course platform of your own from scratch and I'm intensely interested in kind of the motivations and technical hurdles that people are facing when they're building a course platform and how they think about that. But before we get into that, I was wanting to ask you, how do you personally approach learning when you come into something that's complex, whether it's something, you know, in your programming life or otherwise, when you're learning a new complex topic, how do you think about it and approach a new subject? I think it depends on mostly if I know what I don't know yet. If I know what I don't know, I try to go for specifics. For that, I actually use Egghead a lot because I like I can go straight to the specifics, get what I need, and then start using it. When it's something a bit more broad that I'm not sure what goes into it that I don't know. I was trying to learn about building Express APIs, but I had no knowledge about Express. Then I go for something more broad, more complete. That teaches me what I don't know yet. Like for example, Westbos courses and things like that. Right. So it's kind of, it really depends on where you're starting from and the known unknowns and if you're completely new or if you have some experience and just need specifics. So it sounds like you like to take courses and courses are part of your learning experience. Is that over books? Do you prefer taking a course before you'll reach for a book these days? To be honest, I don't think it's about the format. I think it's more about who created it. I have both. I take a lot of courses mostly. The ones that are not, because I have, I think the only platform I'm subscribed right now is Egghead. So whatever I don't find in Egghead, I get courses from Westbos or Kent. I never get to pronounce the last name, Kent C. Dodds, I think. Yeah, that's it. You nailed it. And things like that. But sometimes I also get books. For example, for most of the UI things I do with Ionic, it's always books, but mostly because the authors are people that I already know and that are really good at explaining themselves. So it's a vibe that you have with the creator of the material versus the format itself. You're not as concerned about format. It's how is it delivered and do you trust the source, too, I suspect? Yeah, I believe that's the biggest part, trusting if that person will help me get where I want to be. What are some of the qualities of your favorite courses? Like when you take one and it's really effective, regardless of who delivers it, what do you really like to see when you're using that format? Lots of examples. Like things that I can start trying immediately that are not like a big build up. I don't know if you've seen that where you see two or three chapters in a book trying to build something and it's just a day you do this, but you don't get to see the results up until, I don't know. You're not running it, right? You're just, you're kind of, you keep building it and you don't get to see it and you see no results. And then finally, it's ta-da. Exactly. That's a big one for me because sometimes you spend hours trying to build something and then when you get to that point, you see, okay, it's not working. There is an issue somewhere and then you need to figure out where the issue is. So when it's more, you start building something and testing it immediately. You get that, like that really close or really fast feedback loop. So you know that, you know if you are on the right path or on the right track. So you also teach people and I'm curious, what's your relationship between how you personally do research and to learn something on your own and the research process that you would perform to create a new course that you are producing? For me, there are two parts of the research process. One is like I took 30 by 500 by Amy and Alex. So I do a lot of safari. Most the official Ionic blog or the Firebase mailing list, those are like my two big sources and I try to find patterns there to see what people keep bringing up. And the other one is my own newsletter. Like right now my newsletter is close to 5,000 subscribers, like 400, 4,000 something. So whenever I start getting like common questions or the same question over and over, I know, okay, this is a good topic for an E-bomb or this is a good, something I can expand more to create something a bit bigger, like a course or a short book or something like that. You said E-bomb and E-bomb is like a piece of content that provides value that you send out like a blog post or one of your newsletters, right? That's from Sales Safari, which is part of 30 by 500 that Alex Hillman and Amy Hoy created. Just to provide some background for folks that haven't heard that before. And I can't agree with you more on the examples being a huge important component of building a course. And I think something that people get stuck on when they're designing learning material is what to come up with for examples. And I was wondering if you had consistent sources of inspiration for that, or how do you decide what to? There are mostly two. First is if I've used whatever it is that I'm trying to teach in my day-to-day job. We do a lot of enterprise development for logistics companies. So we usually get to play around with a lot of new things and a lot of complex things. So if I've done something there, I try to adapt from what I already. If not, I try to ask directly my newsletter, my mailing list, but not asking, what do you want me to build? More asking, okay, I'm working on this subject. Have you built something with this? Have you struggled with something? Is there anything that you need from me? Do you need any help? And with that, I usually go through the answers and see, okay, what people is building? Or if someone asks for help, I help them directly and then see if anything I did there is something that I... How important is it that examples or exercises that you roll into learning material be related to the real world? Because you mentioned the enterprise and I think that's interesting because I feel like a lot of software training kind of diverts from the enterprise level of software creation. And I'm wondering how do you kind of keep it grounded in that while still keeping it interesting for folks? I think that if the closer you are to real world examples, the easier it is for people to imagine themselves doing it. If not, when you try to build something and you say, okay, I want to showcase this functionality and you just try to go with whatever it is you want, I feel that the people reading it or watching the video can tell from that. I think that they get something different when it's something that is actually for use. That it's not something that you build for an example, but that it's something that has a real application, a real use. How do you know when somebody succeeded when they're taking one of your courses? What are some of the signs you look for of success for learners? That's a difficult one. I usually try to have automated emails a week, two weeks later after they go through an ebook or a course or something like that. But I feel like a lot of people don't really reply. When they reply, they try to make you feel good. So yeah, I went through the book, it was really good and you can tell by the generic-ness of the response that they were just trying to be nice. So I try to ask them for specifics. What would you change? What was difficult for you? Did you have any issues when you were trying to implement something and things like that to see? It is really hard because people will try to save your feelings. It's like when you're teaching. I've taught a lot of live workshops and when you stop and say, does anybody have any questions? And you know that they have questions because there's no way that they don't. But nobody's hand goes up and it's very challenging to get that sort of candid feedback, I think. Yeah. I was a teacher in a university before going into tech and it was like that. Nobody had questions, but as soon as the class was over and everyone was leaving, a few people would always come to the desk like, hey, could you help me with this? I didn't understand that and things like that. It's interesting because it's more of a one-on-one, right? Like they were in that situation, they didn't want to raise their hand in front of the group, but afterwards and they're going to express their questions because it's more private, I guess. Yeah. Did any of your experience as an educator or teaching at university, has that translated or what have you carried over from that experience into being an online teacher for software developers? I'm not sure if it's that it has things that have carried over. It's more like it became the reason why I started doing it. More than programming, I like teaching, but I don't know how it is in the US, but it's really hard to make a living, a good living as a teacher here. That's everywhere. Yeah, it's everywhere. So I was trying to say, okay, what can I do that can combine that, that I can start or that I can keep teaching, but at the same time, I need to be able to provide. So that's how it all started. I started writing blog posts, trying to help people and trying to teach, trying to write and things like that. Not sure if specifics of what I was doing in the past has carried over to my courses or my books or something like that. For me, it was more like the reason it all started. Yeah, the kind of the journey and I mean, I would assume some of it has to affect it just because you're comfortable with your ability to, but not directly translating from classroom university experience to what you're teaching now. So you've been teaching for a while and I was wondering, have you seen any success stories from students that have motivated you or kind of kept you going? What sort of feedback in that regard, like where you can witness their success, not necessarily them telling you that they've been successful, but have you witnessed success? I had, this was a really cool experience. I was invited to a meet up in Medellin about Angular and I met two people there that approached me after my talk was done and they actually said that they had bought my first book. It was a book I remember about getting started with Ionic and Firebase. They were building websites in their company and because of the book, they said that they had been able to move from the web team to the mobile team and that they were able to get a good promotion, a good raise because of that. That feels good. Oh, really good. I was just like on the clouds that day. And other than that, it's mostly when you see people that keep writing to you to, not to tell you that the course work or that the book was good or something like that. But when you see that they keep asking or bringing up different type of issues, different scenarios, different situations, like they are able to keep growing. You see that they are not asking now, I don't know how to connect to Firebase and fetch data, but you see that they are asking more about, okay, how can I do the transaction so that if several people at the same time are trying to edit a document, they don't overwrite the data and things like that. You see their questions go up in skill level and can witness them actually increase their knowledge and understanding. Yeah, that's awesome. Because not a lot of people reply and reply multiple times to the newsletters, but the few that do that, you start to remember the names and you see that, oh, it's him again. Oh, it's them again and things like that. And you see, and you're able to compare what you were talking about a year or two in the past to what you're talking about now. So something I'm interested in, I've been building a course platform for many years and I noticed that you've constructed your own course platform and I think that's something that software developers will lean more towards than other folks, but I'm wondering why not just use something that exists on the market? Why not just use Podia or Teachable or something that's already existing and instead build your own course platform? What has that done for you? At the time that I made the decision to build it, it was not really because the other ones that were out there were lacking features. I was just not interested in them at that point, but it was mostly because I felt that some of my skills were getting rusty because the type of work I've been doing for the past year and a half has been a little less technical and a little more managerial. So I decided to have something on production on my own, something that people were going to use, something that could break, that I could see why it broke, that I could fix. So it was more of a selfish type of things to keep my skills sharp. It was the course platform because when I was thinking, okay, what do I build? It was like, okay, I have a good deal of content. Let's just go with this one. I know that people are going to use it and I know that they can tell me when something breaks or what I need to fix and things like that. When you describe the platform that you built with JS Mobile Dev, the course platform, how do you describe it or what kind of features are most essential to you as you build the platform? There are a lot of things in my mind that I would like to implement, but right now what I see it is a simple, it's a place where people can, like you go in, you log in, you get to the content that you want to learn and that's that. Right now I don't have anything fancy. There are a couple of things that I would love to get the time to implement soon, but right now it's just that. It's there and it help you get the content that you need. If you could snap your fingers and have, you know, like any feature added to your course platform, what would you, what would be the first thing then? I would like to have a way for people to automatically add context to the questions of their requests for help. I don't know, maybe you are watching the third video of a course and you have a question there and that you are able to just click something and that could be information about the video, what part of the video you are on and I don't know, things like that. So that it's easier for me when I read the question to be able to like, to see, okay, where do I start answering this? What have they done and things like that. We've been building something similar where it's this idea of context within video training is really difficult, right? It's a, it's kind of a dense medium and allowing them to comment and ask questions in, in the context of the time code of the video. I don't know if that makes sense, but that's something that we've literally been working on that for a year and it's a very challenging thing. I'm with you. I'm going to cross my fingers and get that same feature. I think that's a good one. Have you noticed any advantages or anything that's felt really good to you in terms of having complete control over your platform and the delivery of it? Do you think it's enhancing the learning experience? I'm not sure. I would say that if I had more time, yes, I would see a lot of benefits because like I said, there are things that I would like to have that maybe they are not available someplace else, but it's not a real benefit at the moment because I just don't have the time to build it. Yeah. And you're, I mean, you're balancing a full-time job and doing this also, so I'm sure that really kind of bites into your time as having to work. Yeah. How do you balance that then the idea of working on the platform versus creating or maintaining the material for the platform? Because it's two different things. It's two kind of radically different jobs. Yeah. It's really hard. Right now, start, I believe was the second week of January, I moved part time because I truly want to like to dedicate more time, not only to the course platform, but to actually generating more content. So that's the only thing I could think of to be able to do that because having the full-time job plus creating the content is not really something that I think it's impossible, but having the full-time job, creating the content and then adding the features and then fixing the bugs. Yeah. It takes a lot of time and I've always wanted to be a company of one, like I have absolutely no interest in creating a big company, having employees, partners or anything like that. So it's just me. So it usually takes a lot of time to be able to do things. So I'm curious, and you're a professional and you're a professional software developer and it sounds like you've got quite a bit of experience, but has there been any surprising technical challenges while through the process of building your platform? There have been challenges. I don't think it's because they have been extremely difficult, it's more just trying to do something too fast. It makes you be a little bit careless. Just a quick example, I had a bug in the registration process because when I created it, it was working fine. Like people would go get a course, sign up, it will create the account, add all the necessary data and they will have access. But then that cloud function would break if the user already existed in the platform. As I said, there are a lot of personal things going on right now, so time is non-existent. So I had to quickly just turn off the function and put the videos available for download while I get the time to be able to fix that. Yeah, so it's just kind of technical, it's the complexity of the system more than any specific surprise that has popped out at you. And you shared some of this, that you want to do this full-time and be a company of one, but what's the long-term goal of building your own platform, creating these courses? I think that my long-term goal is more related to creating the content than to maintaining the platform. I believe that with enough time, I can get the platform to a decent level where I can just focus mostly on not having to spend too much time maintaining or adding things and focusing more on the content. It doesn't matter the amount of features you have, the, I don't know, the expanded levels of performance, if there is no good content that people can go and check out. That's the truth. Yeah, I think that's true too. And you know, like all the fancy features or delivery mechanism really doesn't matter if the content isn't effective at the end of the day and doesn't get people to where they want to be. Jorge, I got to say, I really enjoyed talking to you and I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me and I'm very excited to see what you do and see where you take this and see what kind of content you deliver. I bought one of the courses and I did it for research for this, but also because I'm very interested in the content that you teach. It's relevant to my interests otherwise. So thank you for that too. I'm looking forward to digging in in more depth and again, thank you so much for chatting with me today. All right, it was my pleasure.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"So I want to talk to you about building free code camp and an education platform for developers. I was wondering first though, like what's your approach when you sit down to learn something new? I know that you're researching math and data science currently. And how do you, given the full scope of the internet, what do, what is your kind of approach to learning a new, a difficult topic during the pandemic? I learned a lot about music and music theory and composition and things like that. And so maybe I can walk you through how I went about doing that. So first I just kind of like go to like Wikipedia, like music composition or something like that, like some very, extremely high level, broad, you know, queries, and then I start to figure out, okay, like, I think like one of the things I like to do is try to find somebody who actually has gone through this process before, which you can often find like blog posts or, you know, YouTube blogs, like day 300 of me trying to learn this thing. And, and that can be really useful because often like you just go to their YouTube channel, you sort by like the most viewed video, and then you find that, and then it's usually somebody like, like everything I've learned from this process, and then you can skip a lot of the other stuff and you can, so the idea is you get a big picture, kind of 35,000 foot view of the thing you're trying to learn. In my case, it was just, you know, like how to play drums, how to play bass, how to compose like melodies and stuff like that. And then you just zoom in on the individual things. And as you're learning one thing, you'll say, oh, this is related to this. And, you know, it would be great if there was a cohesive linear curriculum for everything where you could just drop in and start at the beginning. And it was time tested and tons of people have been through it. And there was a community ready to help you through there. And I think in learning music, there are such things, but it's a little more scattered. There wasn't like a kind of multidisciplinary place where you could learn composition and music theory and, you know, actual playing and technique and stuff like that. But yeah, I just try to like, go from like big picture and figure out how things are connected before you get mired in the minutia. Like, like I often, when I learned to program, I made a ton of mistakes. One of the biggest mistakes I made was like not choosing a stack and sticking with it. Like the grass was always greener on the other side. So I jumped to some new tool or, and then you're basically, you can absolutely spend a thousand hours learning a hundred hours worth of stuff 10 times if you're not careful. So I would definitely try to back out and then I would make conscientious decisions to constrain your learning. And I would actually make sure you get all the way through them and don't let yourself throw caution to the wind and like start over. For me, I always, I called it when I was learning to code particularly in this, like it was a four stack overflow when I was trying to do it and it was books. And I would always call it the chapter four problem. I would get to like chapter four in a C plus book and stop and then move on to some other language and get to chapter four. You know, I knew what strings and arrays and variables were pretty well, but like when it started getting into, you know, now do this at the exercise portion of chapter four, I'd be like, this is not for me. I need to move on and try something different. And I think that's true for a lot of things because your brain just gets so overwhelmed with new vocabulary and new, you know, just so much. One of my favorite books is badass by Kathy Sierra. And she talks about in this, this idea that you're learning at a higher resolution as you gain expertise. So you start at that 35,000 foot view and what you're actually doing is like increasing your resolution as you spiral in on a topic where it's like, here's the whole thing. And then you're going to get down to, you know, like, like a very fine grained look and you start getting into the details of it. I still, I love that way of thinking, but the spiral approach to learning is, is, is really fascinating to me. Awesome. Yeah. I'll check out that book. I was able to pull it up on Google books and just read it. It's one of my favorites. We've at egghead, we sent every instructor that comes on board and makes a course gets, we send them equipment and that's part of the gearbox that we send as a copy of that book. So I've sent out hundreds of copies of it. I love it. And it's one of my favorite, like instructional design texts that's ever been produced. Awesome. So you're sitting down and free code camp doesn't exist. What made you decide to build a platform for folks to learn how to code? Yeah, so I was working as a school director and then I'll spare you like the long backstory, but basically I just needed to figure out how to make it so my teachers could spend more time with students and less time on their computers filling out, you know, grade reports and compliance documents and stuff like that. So I just needed to learn some basic automation stuff and keep in mind, I was a 30 year old dude in a suit, like in an office trying to, to get things done on like an old crappy windows box from Dell, you know, like the kind that like every corporation just, well, took a thousand of them. That was like the, and I didn't know very much about technology at all. I just merely consumed technology. I didn't produce technology and I didn't think I was smart enough to produce technology, but I went down, I just started Googling stuff and gradually my confidence built and I was like, Oh, I can do this. I can do this. And that's when I realized like, Oh wow. Like I needed to solve these very specific problems and I am, you know, solving them, learning these tools and they're getting done and like everybody's happy at the school and things are getting done. Like how many people are there around the world that could probably benefit from learning how to solve these problems using technology? Like this was right around the time that like AWS was really becoming like widely known, like, Hey, I could just spin up a server in the cloud and it can just do this service and I can pay 20 or 50 bucks a month to keep it running and, you know, I can go about my way with this tool that I can hit or maybe people will pay to access it and, and at the same time, this was like, like the API economy was growing, this was around 2011, I think. And I was just like, wow. Like if I could just teach people how to use this, we could dramatically increase people's free time. We could dramatically increase people's confidence with technology. So very early on in the process, I decided like, I left my job and just studied full time for about nine months and then I got a job as a software engineer and that's when like I really started learning when I was on the job. So I was like, we should just create a path that gets people to their first job as quickly as possible. And that was the genesis of Free Code Camp and the intention of Free Code Camp. And I'd argue that we've delivered on that vision to some extent in the sense that tens of thousands of people have gone through and have been able to get their first developer job and are now learning on the job, really doing the hard learning when, you know, they've got a boss and they've got colleagues and they've got accountability and all that. What's the, like you've, you've, you're tens of thousands of people. It's more than that. I would probably say hundreds of thousands of people have come through Free Code Camp and you know, like you'll get various levels of success, but what, what kind of patterns have you noticed that learners are coming to Free Code Camp and what difference are they trying to make in their lives that brings them to Free Code Camp in the first place? Yeah, most people just want to provide for their families. The median user is like maybe 30 years old. Maybe they've been working in accounting. Maybe they've been driving a bus or we have a lot of people in the community who are just like in retail. Like they went to college for a while, something happened. They got sick. Their family member got sick. Any number of things, they weren't able to finish that degree. They've just been servicing their student debt and trying to get through or get, like, there's always been the expectation that this is not where their life is going. This is not where their life ends, that they're going to do something else. What is that thing? They're not clear, you know? And then when you tell them, they hear like, Hey, you can get a pretty good job and you can have a high quality of life, you can have pretty interesting creative work if you can learn how to program and, you know, start writing or maintaining software. So that I think is the, that's like a typical person that would come to Free Code Camp is somebody who has not necessarily made up their mind that they want to be a developer, but like, let's give this a shot. Yeah. One of my, like I, the, one of the main reasons I send people to Free Code Camp, cause I love it as a service is like, you want to make a change, but how are you going to like even figure out if you like this thing or something that you're interested in doing? Cause it's not for everybody. I don't think programming computers is for everybody, but if you want to like know and understand that Free Code Camp is such a great place to start and just see and get your, you know, like dip into it and then, you know, expand into the community and there's all sorts of good avenues and I'd be wondering, you know, like specifically how is Free Code Camp helping people achieve that difference and, you know, like what is the platform itself doing to facilitate? Yeah. So we have the, you know, the core curriculum, which is what we steer people toward if they're new to software development and just looking for a sane place to start, you know, it's an ocean and, you know, you can try to drink that ocean or you can select pockets of water to drink, you know, you don't have to drink the whole thing, like nobody, like if you do a job search, like on Indy.com or LinkedIn or wherever, you're going to see like all these technologies that people think you're supposed to know and stuff. And you probably only need to know like a few key things. Like I tell people, they probably just need to know JavaScript and Python and SQL and Linux and Git, and, you know, maybe some engineering math, you know, data structures, algorithms, things like that, and some HTML and CSS. And if they know those things, they can probably do like 70% of the Java things out there or in, or at the very least they'll have the conceptual framework upon which they can just, if you know one high level scripting language, you can probably go learn the other ones. If you know a high level scripting language, you can probably go down a few layers of abstraction and learn something like Java or C plus or Rust. So one of the things that I'm wondering is related to that. How do you make curriculum decisions when you're deciding what to teach? What, what's the process for deciding what's next or, or what, what you're actually going to demonstrate and educate people on? Yeah. A lot of the decision making is around what are people hiring for? because again, like the people who use Free Code Camp, a lot of them may have time, they're not necessarily like, like they probably have a job at Starbucks or they have a job at like DoorDash or something, and they're just, they're able to carve out some time and just learn a little bit by little over the course of nine months or 16 months or something like that, and so what we try to do is make things really granular and make sure we're only teaching things that really need to be taught, but at the same time that we aren't skipping over things, the best place in my opinion to start is just teaching people HTML and CSS because there's a tight feedback loop. Like you change something in HTML and like the DOM immediately gets updated in the little preview window and you're like, Oh, okay, I get, my brain is making the connection that this causes this. If you try to teach people, for example, like Java or something where they have to like type in the code and then they had to compile the code and then run the code and then there's like some sort of output and they had to figure out, okay, like they had to put it in like, you know, debug statements and stuff like that to be able to figure out what's actually going on in the code. But if you start people with HTML, CSS, it's, some people would say it's easy. I take issue with the idea that CSS is easy. It's pretty, it can be pretty challenging and it can get as difficult. It's got a lot of depth. That's how I like to describe it. Absolutely. Chess is easy. It's only eight pieces. How many moves are there? Like, yeah, but it takes, you know, an afternoon to learn chess. It takes a lifetime to master it. And I would argue the same thing with CSS. Maybe it takes a little more than an afternoon to learn basic CSS, but that's a good place to start. And then, you know, JavaScript similarly can be run in the browser. JavaScript is probably like, you know, Atwood's law, anything that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript. I believe that is largely true. And yes, there are some things that like, you know, Julia or Rust or some other programming language would be much better at, but JavaScript is like the good enough at pretty much any use case tool, so that's the one we start with. There are a lot of things we'd like to teach that are hard to teach interactively and hard to teach in a browser, so we, it's taken us a long time to design the curriculum. For example, it was really hard to figure out how we were going to teach Linux commands and bash and shell scripting and stuff like that. When, how do you do that in the browser? Like you would have this really slow thing. Like you might be able to find something that interprets these commands or you might be able to fake it where, oh, type this command, oh, look, it worked. Here's your file system update. But we're really just like, you know, faking it. Yeah. So we wanted to actually have a proper environment, which is why ultimately it took several years of development, but now we have a relational database course. You need to do it in a Docker instance and you do it inside of VS code and you do it step-by-step, but you actually have an entire Linux environment. You actually have, you know, a file system and a command line and all that stuff. Yeah. And it's amazing because the environment's important, I think, for learning. And then how do you immerse people in and give them that authenticity is really what it's about, right? If it's all simulated and all fake when they actually hit the real environment, then a lot of times it might be tough to translate too. Yeah. Another note on that people will experience like blank canvas effect when they get out of a linear kind of progression of tutorials or instructions and suddenly they just have a big list of tests that they have to get to pass. We intentionally confront them with that experience as early and as gently as we can, because we don't want people to get hubris and think, oh, I'm the king of the world. Like, you know, banging out, like, like a lot of people, the old curriculum, the way it was designed, like they wouldn't necessarily get to those projects until they were maybe like 50 or 60 hours into the curriculum. But with the updated curriculum within, you know, maybe like five hours or so of learning, you're actually confronted with like, we call them boss battles. Oh, nice. There's like the level. And then there's the boss battle and the boss battle. If you're familiar with video games, like Star Fox, you're on the rails, it's a rail shooter and you're like flying around and shooting things. But the camera's moving at a deliberate pace and everything's pretty scripted. Like this ship is going to come out of here and you're going to shoot it and then you're going to gather like rings and whatever. But then when you get to the boss, it opens up and you can fly anywhere and suddenly it's like, oh my gosh, like there's so much freedom. But at the same time, there's so much apprehension associated with it. Like you suddenly you've got enough rope to hang yourself if you're not careful. So we try to get people to confront that early on because we do want to check their ego. We don't want people to, because the longer you let someone persist in the delusion that, oh, I totally understand how this works, the harder the come down is going to be when they realize, oh damn, like I really have just scratched the surface. Yeah. But like they're going to crash harder, right? Like it's going to feel worse because you felt so good. Now it's going to just feel bad and it's truly hard too. And you know, it's like, like that's important to acknowledge as well. I think it's interesting because you're talking about like game design, essentially like the design of video games and not gamification in the corny sense, I think that the marketing set has used and ruined that term, but gamification and the idea that, you know, games are fun because there's some challenge and you're rewarded and you know, there's ups and downs and successes and failures and that's what makes it interesting. And I'm curious, do you have like a, an instructional design philosophy? You said you had a background as an educator, so I'm wondering, you know, does that carry over and is there a, like an overarching instructional design philosophy or framework that, that you've consistently used over the years or like now, I guess. Yeah. Game design informs a lot of our instructional design decisions. One concept in game design that I think is really helpful is time to first encounter. Right? Like how long does it take after you pick up the blaster off the ground before you're shooting a demon with it? Right. Like if that's a few seconds, that's going to really get people in the game quickly. If there's like tons of exposition and cut scenes and explanatory, you know, prose, they're going to, you know, so that has been one thing is like, when you start up pre-code camp, like, yes, we do have like a little thing like, Hey, this is going to be hard. You know, we like try to set expectations. And then very quickly within, you know, a minute or so, people have read that and then click through and then they're boom, they're in the code editor. So that's one thing. Another concept that's really useful for us is like feedback. How tight is the feedback loop in Tetris? If I try to move the piece to the right and I click the thing and it goes all the way to the right and it's bumping up against the side, it's not going to go any farther and that immediately tells me, Oh, that doesn't work. I need to figure out some other way. I need to rotate it or something like Tetris is probably the most perfect game ever created in, in, in the sense that it does what it's supposed to do. And it does it very well and it's self-explanatory and it probably couldn't be any simpler than it is. So I have to look like Tetris. Okay. Like, like, Oh, wow. I just got four lines and there's this giant, you know, I don't know, like a fanfare played or something like that. I can't remember the term, but, but like, and everything flashed, you know, like, Oh no, the pieces are getting really high. How do I get rid of these? Oh, I got four in a line. That's how you get rid of them. Like you could take somebody who never played Tetris. Like, it'd be hard to find somebody that had never played Tetris, but you could take somebody who never played it. And I bet you, if you sat down and watched within two or three minutes, they they'd figure out how it works. And they'd be progressing at least like level two or level three, maybe getting 10 or 20 lines because the game is so intuitively designed. Obviously programming is a lot harder, but if you look at a lot of contemporary video games, like if you try to play like dark souls or doom eternal, or one of these games, like you're going to be confronted with tons of different buttons and different things you can be doing at any one time. And like tons of different ways you can solve any given, you know, scenario. And I think as games become more complicated, they get closer to resembling programming. And as programming gets simpler and it's way simpler than it used to be, we're sitting on like, you know, hundreds of mattresses of abstraction, you know, between us and the P down there, it does become easier. And I am confident that at some point programming will be as simple as it is in Star Trek, where they walk up to the computer, cross-reference the location of this, you know, quasar with all the flights that have come through in the past six months, and then send it to my screen, you know, something like that. We can just speak what you're thinking and it'll appear for you. Yeah. Like super duper declarative programming. So yeah, I think that games inform the design more than anything. And yes, I am a teacher. I'm familiar with like pedagogy and all that stuff. And I've gone to many conferences and heard lots of talks and poured through academic papers, all this stuff. I mean, I am convinced that video games and game development are probably the future of education. How do you make education so fun that people find intrinsic value in continuing doing it rather than just the extrinsic value, like, Hey, learn this. Or you're going to be working in retail for the rest of your life. Right. Yeah, for sure. And I remember like when I was on a TI computers, Texas instruments coding logo when I was in third grade, which dates me a bit, but like, I just remember that, you know, it's like this fun and this experience and, and, you know, up through like Oregon trail and they've been trying to do this for years, right? Like this idea that video games can also be fun and educational. And I think that's really true. And you see it in some, like there's even interesting coding environments like scratch and other things. I think that are a good examples of, of some of the ways that this can be more fun for, for people and still meet educational goals. And I honestly think that like that idea that we can incorporate fun, like learning doesn't have to be some, somebody standing at a lectern, just spewing facts at you for one and a half hour blocks. And that's what education is. I just don't think that's it. I don't think that's how our brains really function. And it's the outmoded way of doing things that's changing. Just, you know, the internet changes it. Zoom changes it. Like the interactive learning through websites changes. It's really fascinating to me. I also think instructional design is a underrepresented skill set in like our, our kind of almost like zeitgeist in general, we don't pay teachers enough. And we don't value this idea, but teaching others is a cornerstone of the advance of our civilization in a lot of ways. Yeah. Thankfully in places like South Korea and places like Norway, they do pay teachers quite a bit more. And I think that you know, in the U S we definitely take people with PhD seriously, and hopefully that will increasingly become so, and people, you know, everybody will be bringing on, you know, consultants who actually have like a strong background in teaching and have classroom experience as well as like theoretical experience and not just classroom experience, but like experience writing a book experience, designing a course. Cause that's in some respects harder than teaching in the classroom because there's less feedback. Like you really don't know, and you don't have control. Yeah. So you sit down and you free co-camp does not exist. There's plenty of different ways you could have approached it. And why did you choose to build custom versus using something that you might be able to find online? I didn't do a lot of like MOOCs as they were called back then. Like I did a lot of courses on edX and Coursera and I read lots of books and I just found that there wasn't a lot of like, it's easy to delude yourself into thinking you understand the subject when all you're doing is consuming and not being forced to produce. So again, it went back to that feedback problem. The moment like, and in fact, I describe a lot of the first few months of me learning to code as me reading stuff and thinking, all right, I got this. Then I go to a hackathon and I went to hackathons almost every weekend. I, I took the, the Cal train up and down the coast because I was living in Santa Barbara at the time and I'd like rail up to like San Francisco or rail down to Santa Barbara or I'd drive over to, to like Las Vegas and I do hackathons every weekend and that was great because there was feedback, like the, what is the remedy for optimism is feedback, like, like, or the remedy for hubris. I can't remember the expression, but basically left to your own devices. Most people will come to think like, you know, I am God in this realm. If they keep like taking stuff in, but they never have their proverbial, you know, if they never get punched in the face, as they might say, right? Like my reality is like kicking you while you're down and you're like, oh my gosh, I'm not as strong as I thought I was. Right. I think people like, like I genuinely thought, oh, I'm, I'm a developer now. Like, look at all these books I've read. And so for me, I was like, I don't want people to go around diluted thinking that, you know, Free Code Camp, because they read a bunch of articles on Free Code Camp, that they're going to be great developers and then go into an interview and get shot down. Like right from the beginning, I need to make sure people understand how hard this is and how frustrating and how ambiguous it is and you know, like, yes, a lot of people are going to see that and nope out of it, but a lot of people are going to be like, okay, like having calibrated my expectations, I now know that it's, especially when everywhere you turned, at least at the time, learned to code in three weeks, you know, like there's like this company called One Month and it's like One Month Ruby, learn all of Ruby in one month. And like, they were like serious. They seriously thought they could teach people Ruby like enough to be a developer, or at least that's what they told people and some people might have believed that, but yeah, it's not an easy task. It's very hard to learn to program. Anybody who tells you programming is easy is not doing you any favors. So immediately I was like, we need to have tight feedback loop. We need for people to be punched in the face by reality repeatedly. I'm sorry. I can't think of like a, like a more gentle, like I'm aware that there's a lot of violence and metaphors, like bullet points and things like that. Right. I'm trying to use garden analogies. Like maybe, maybe they haven't had their crops, you know, withered. Dipped in the cold water of reality. Yeah, exactly.\")\n",

Like when you, your expectations meet reality and if they don't aren't aligned, you get a system shock and all of a sudden, um, you know, like, like you got to rethink and reevaluate your course of action and your previous conceptions of, of what reality is and kind of get pushed off the mountain top a little bit and start your climb again. Yeah. Yeah. So that was like, we needed to be interactive. We need it to be hard and it started off a lot harder than it is now. And now we've got like these really gentle error, like, like hints instead of just failing test messages and error messages and stuff to try to cheer people back on, but that was one of the things it was like, just. Yeah, it was too in university course, universities are like this too. You can think that, you know, everything until you walk into that midterm and bomb and then like, okay, like halfway through the course, you get the feedback that you don't understand the material. Now you've got the remaining half to try to figure everything out before the final, and you won't actually know if you know it until you've taken the final. It's such course evaluation criteria that it really leaves a lot to be desired in my opinion. So, you know, we have computers that can, you know, run code within a few, uh, milliseconds and then give you the feedback. Why not use them? And when you're building free code chem, you talked about this a little bit, particularly in the, you know, your database and relational databases course, where it was really hard to provide that environment for them. And that was a technical hurdle. But in the early days, what were the, like the largest technical hurdles that you faced when you were building the platform? Yeah, I would say the hardest, almost all the hard things we're just trying to figure out ways to teach things, interact, especially if it's a conceptual thing, like how, if you normally you would like condense a lecture down into like a single series of problems, but like, how do you teach on like, how do you get people coding? Or like a lot of times there's a copy paste this command. Great. Now, you know how to make a rest. Can we like, like how do you do that in a way where you're not completely holding their hand? Where they actually have to perform the task instead of, of just consuming it or, or clipping it from one place and moving it to another, which isn't going to help them very much. Like it's such a, uh, easy thing to just say, Oh, here's a multiple choice question. Did you understand the question? You know, things where, and I, it is hard. And we use multiple choice questions in our Python curriculum, but yeah, it's. A lot of free code games curriculum. I'm still not particularly proud of, just because I know that we can absolutely do better and it's just a whole lot of work to actually execute. You know, you know, that whole saying, what was it? It was like, uh, Noah, Ira Glass, I think is his name. He had this saying like, like, the worst thing is when you're just starting out, you have taste because you consume good instructional design or you've played a good video game. Right? Like, you know what a good video game is and you know what you're producing is not a good video game, but just knowing that what you've produced is not good, but that it's like the first step to actually creating something that is good. You have to start with taste. And as an instructional designer, you have to know, okay, this is like, I'm not proud of this or like people are never going to get this, or this is going to be frustrating for a learner. You have to know that you're doing your best, but it's going to take many iterations to get to something that's as seamless as, you know, Star Trek where Captain Picard is, you know, talking to the computer, the iteration and the idea that it's something, you know, like otherwise this wouldn't exist. Right? Like if you do not iterate and you do not put something out into the world at all, then it doesn't exist. And how do you make anything good? And the only, like the only answer to me, it's like, how do you get good at any skill is through practice. And that includes producing courses and curriculum, right? Like you're teaching people to get good at skills, but you also need to gain and skills and gain that higher resolution on the, you know, very real and tangible skills you are learning as a platform builder, educator, curriculum designer, you know, interactive courseware producer, right? Like those are all skills that you and your team need to, to skill up on. And just in the same way that the people that you're sharing knowledge with need to skill up on, on some of the core stuff so that eventually they could look at these higher level problems like you're doing now, right? Like you have to get past HTML and CSS as, as skills before you can, you know, like code your educational platform for the most part, right? That's just kind of the nature of learning. And I really think that's interesting to me is that, that, you know, you'll put it out there, even though, you know, it's going to be a little bit frustrating and it's not polished and it's not, you know, it's like, this doesn't taste good. What do we need to do next? I think that's a really healthy approach. Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, pardon me for talking about myself rather than talking about instructional design, but like with my journey into music, I knew that I needed feedback and I need, I needed to like, is this good? Is this going to work? You know, and you can think that you've got like the best music in the world. You have to put it out there and actually get feedback. And it's the same thing with instructional design. So like, like, you know, I started putting my tracks out there and then people would be like, Oh, you know, this sounds janky, you know, like you get all kinds of feedback and that helps guide you in the path because as immaculate as the vision in your head may be for where you need to go, there are all kinds of hidden realities that, that your platonic solid of an idea, you know, it's not going to be a platonic solid, it's going to be a crazy lumpy ball, but it will ultimately serve the purpose because it will have incorporated all this feedback. And at the same time, there's a balance that gets straight because if you incorporate too much feedback, then it mitigates your original vision to the extent that it's just like, you know, trying to be everything for everybody. So those are other, you know, yes, this one person had trouble with this specific challenge, but that does not mean that the challenge is bad. We have to step back and take like, you know, several million people have done this coding challenge. So it couldn't be broken. Like it, maybe it's just misleading. And so every piece of feedback, you have to know when the feedback is representative and, or when, okay, if we actually wanted to address this specific piece of feedback, it would involve doing all this additional work and what it like, and when to be technically correct, or just to, just to clutch things a little bit for the sake of not having to go on a massive say, you know, side mission to explain how to do something right. Yeah. Does, and just listening to that, and I think this is interesting too, the fact that it's free. Code camp, I think in some ways probably helps and allows you to iterate because you know, like I build a commercial course and if I'm charging you for that course, if you have to pay for it, there's like this expectation of quality, but when you can fall back to like, look, it's free and we're working on it and it's going to be better if that has to remove at least some of the pressure from the overall process, I would think. Yeah. Like on the form for everybody who's like, Oh man, what the hell is wrong with this curriculum? It sucks. They'll be like, beggars can't be choosers or PR is accepted. Yeah, yeah, exactly. We can, we're open source. It was like opening GitHub issue. And often I do, I don't do that as a snarky way of like dismissing somebody's complaints. I legitimately mean it. If I say like, Hey, could you open a GitHub issue or, or maybe would you be interested in helping create a PR to fix this? These are not like me trying to offload stuff. Like I genuinely want to get people involved in the open source contribution process, but you're absolutely right. The fact that it's free code camp, like we've never had somebody request a refund. Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. I can't say the same. So like, like I see the advantages and you know, it's like, there's, we could do a whole podcast episode, I think on the economics of free code camp and versus the commercial nature of it, but I think that's a pretty cool from a design perspective, cause you can get things out there, get feedback, iterate and build something truly nice over time without kind of the pressures of, you know, servicing paying customers, which always throws a dynamic into it. Yeah. That's one thing I've learned is like, you're going to have a lot of different customers who have a lot of different use cases and you know, you don't want to. Upset them. So that's how like a code base becomes a giant legacy code base. And free code game, to be fair, like one, I look at like free code campus is a game of go and not a game of chess. Like you're not taking pieces off the board. You're putting pieces on the board. Once you put a piece on the board, the entire game is going to ripple out from there, right? Like if we create a certification, we cannot remove that certification. There are people who have that certification on their LinkedIn. There are people who have that certification on their CV. We need to continue to maintain that as a legacy certification. Yeah. Backward compatibility. It's very important. And yes, a very small minority of people who use free code camp actually donate to free code camp to give you an idea. We have about maybe like 800,000 visitors a day and you know, like about 7,500 people each month donate to free code camp. So if you do the math, it's like less than 1% of people actually support free cocaine, but we don't want that to be like, like, like we want to treat with everyone's respect, regardless of whether they are helping support the project. Yeah. Like we take all grievances very seriously. That's great. Quincy, I really appreciate it. I really appreciate what you do. I see the difference that your project has made in people's lives because I'm steeped in that community generally, and I've watched people and the difference that your platform and your curriculum has made in people's lives. And just thank you. I think folks, if you're considering it or you use free code camp, you maybe want to get in on some of that sub 1% action and throw a few bucks, maybe a recurring donation to the project because it's fabulous. Anything, anything else you'd like to, anything y'all have going on or anything at free code camp, you'd like people to know about? Yeah. Thank you very much Joel for that. For like, if you're interested in getting involved as a contributor, we welcome it. But like for the purpose of like people who are listening to the show that are interested in creating instructional design, take a look at our updated responsive web design certification that we just, it's technically in beta. I don't know when this is published, if it'll still be in beta, but we spent like three years designing that and I could talk for like an hour about all the design decisions that went into that, but it's extremely granular and we do things like we show people exactly what they're going to build right at the beginning. It's no mystery as they do line by line, like build up this project, get test to pass that they're working towards something cool. And also we try to keep each step like 30 seconds to 120 seconds in terms of like, keep that manic pacing. Like if you're not running tests, like every 30 seconds, there's something wrong with the way we designed that step. I'm just making it really granular, having a tight feedback loop, keeping people like rocketing forward through the curriculum, that's our vision for that. And then at the other side is the relational databases certification, which currently you still have to pull down the Docker image and run locally. But that represents like how we're going to be doing this for the backend. So we're doing the three front end certifications, the four backend certifications, then we got the data science, it's all in Jupyter notebook where you're currently using Google Collaboratory for that, but those are like the three sections of the curriculum. And you can take a look at all those and get a feel for like what we've learned. And if anybody has any specific, like if you're a teacher or if you want some feedback on your instructional design, like definitely send me a DM on Twitter and I'll take a look and I'll give you some feedback, but the, what passes for instruction in this world, like, you know, professors standing at the front of a room, lecturing, you know, textbooks, things like that, like, like we can do better and we're going to do better. And, and, you know, I don't think any of this is beyond what typical developers or teachers could do. Like the tools are out there, they're democratized. Free Code Camp was not particularly expensive to build in the grand scheme of things, we're a 501c3 nonprofit and we've been able to do it, like I spent about $150,000 of my savings bootstrapping the organization as a nonprofit and getting tax exempt status, and, I think that if you're coming with even a modest budget, if you're at an organization, you want to update your onboarding or something like that, if you can marshal any resource, also Free Code Camp is open source, it's BSC3 licensed. You can fork it and you can put your own content into it, or you can repurpose our content, which is all, all this stuff in the curriculum is creative commons 4.0 BYSA. So yeah, I'm sorry. Like that, you were like trying to wind down the podcast. That's awesome. No, that's really cool. Like, I, I think that's that, yeah. Like, thank you for, for sharing all that because that's great information and what a resource, what a, honestly, like what a treasure on the internet, I appreciate that Quincy. Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity to be on your podcast.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"I'm really excited to talk to you. You've built an amazing learning platform, I think, that takes a kind of a unique approach to the technical aspects of platform building, both from the platform itself, like what you've built as a business, and then as learners and kind of enabling people to do things that they otherwise couldn't do. I wanted to kind of break the ice and ask you, when you approach a difficult new topic, what's your strategy? How do you think about learning on the internet or otherwise? Yeah, I think I'm just one of those people that do not read instructions. I will just try and figure it out. So I'd often just jump into something and then try and refer back to something when it ultimately hasn't worked, which happens often when you don't read instructions. So I'm a sort of like darter and diver into, okay, there's like a text-based tutorial here, or there's a YouTube clip here, just skip it straight to where I need to be and find out that piece. And then I think lots of it is like how someone else done it and actually just asking people, because often you can find them on Twitter and stuff about like, how'd you build that thing? Or where's that from? And actually things like, this is one thing that I was looking at Egghead for years when I was building Makepad. So I just stole all my site features from other sites and all the design and everything. Yeah, I'm all about that. That's the way to go. Yeah, definitely. So I remember looking at the Egghead pricing page and I was like, I love how it was just so simple. And I was like, use extensions like built with and whatever, just to see if there's anything I could steal. So I'll try and like dive in that way with certain things like that. It's funny, because I've done the same thing with MakerPad for some of the things that you've done. Like, and I think that's cool. And like, I would encourage people to do that, right? Like go out and actually seek out a way, instead of inventing everything from whole cloth every time, like what works. And it's not like a cut and paste or outright plagiarism or theft. It's just like, well, this looks pretty good. I like this and it's working. So like, why not jump to the finish line instead of starting from scratch? Yeah, and also with like bigger companies, you assume that they've done all the testing. They figured out what the thing actually, like what that sort of page needs to look like because they've got resources. Whereas if you're a small business or a one man band building stuff, like lean on what other people are doing and what's working. So I think, yeah, they probably figure it out. I would warn people that like copying what we've done is probably not gonna fit that particular description you just put out there. But, you know, I think it still stands. So you have your personal learning style and then you sit down and you know, like you're a teacher and an educator on the internet. How does your personal learning style differ from like the way you approach like creating curriculum? Well, most of our content is video based. And I just told you that I prefer text based or I would like a mixture of, yeah, I like a mixture. Yeah, why is it that we've done that then? If we've done both the same thing and think the same, but actually recently we've started making sure that everything also has the transcription. And then I've tried to tone down tutorials where I think early on a couple of years ago would have been, I'll show you, click here to set up an account, click this button to do this, and you just, you get to a point where I think if you're on the other side, do you wanna, do you need to see someone like create an account on this tool? Do you need to see that? Can you just assume some level of common sense and sort of tech proficiency when using a website? But sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's interesting to think about that level of assumption too because you're always kind of catering and it's like, there's this, do we have to go back to square one every time we teach something? Or can we assume people understand login with Google or whatever the mechanism might be and they can kind of jump to pass this account creation bit. And that, I mean, video, like people obviously love it, right? Like YouTube exists and this, and Netflix and just video is something that we all love and consume, but it's like a teaching style thing or how we like to consume or just the, almost like a preference. Like for me, I can watch video on 2X and enjoy it. But if it does not have 2X, it's like, I'm not even going to sit down with it. And I don't know if that's impatience or what, but like the medium itself is aggravating to me just because of sheer speed where text, I can just scan and kind of jump to what I want and visually map it out or whatever, like pattern matching. Yeah, no, I'm definitely, I'm exactly the same with video, especially on YouTube. If I'm looking for a recipe to cook something, I like, I open the transcripts of the YouTube video because I think every YouTube video automatically has one now. And you can just skip to those bits and then scrub through and all, miss all these sort of fluff bits that you actually don't need. How do you describe MakerPad as a platform? I think it's changed every three, six months, probably. It started as a learning community for want-to-be founders, want-to-be entrepreneurs. We're a little unique in that we teach like no code and no code as a term has become semi-popular over the last couple of years. I don't know if we had anything to do with that, but if we did, I would have chosen something, a different term for it. So it's difficult because if we want to say MakerPad is the place to learn no code, you've automatically alienated everyone who's never heard of no code. And people, I think if we're trying to reach the everyday people, which I think we are, like my mom wouldn't type in how to build a website with code or without code in Google. She would just type how to build a website. So there are things that we're constantly playing with and thinking around, well, you can build projects, you can build a business, you can automate work. You don't have to code. And it's just, there's not like a really catchy one-liner in there that we really love and think that we own. So yeah, I mean, there'll be another one out on our homepage in a few weeks, I'm sure. So I'll message you about that one. So I'm a code maximalist, right? Like I will spin up and build a full stack backend. And to me, like this idea of no or low code or like whatever you wanna describe it is, it's almost like a stepping stone and just a smart way to go about things that saves time and kind of removes a lot of technical complexity. Because frankly, no code is a misnomer. Like it's like as a user, it's no code, but there is a ton of code actually getting run behind the scenes. And I was talking to Quincy Larson, he's talking about the future where it's Star Trek and you're the captain on the deck and you just ask the computer to do something and it happens. And like that kind of future is actually pretty interesting to me where we've democratized this ability to create or build something and you don't have to have learned how to program computers at a syntax level. And like I assume that's kind of the goal, right? Like we wanna build something, we wanna get it out there in the world and not have to learn JavaScript to be able to produce anything at all. Yeah, I think it's just, it's an abstraction, right? So it's just not touching the actual code. You're just touching a UI layer on top of that, that ultimately creates the same code that a developer might when they're spinning up a similar site. And like you said, there's a lot of, or there has been conversations around code versus no code, but that's like, that's completely missing the point. I think it's, they're all on the same spectrum of creating software, creating something with software, whereas no, like the no code bit is just the very, very beginning of the really entry level stuff. And then as you graduate, you start playing with webhooks and APIs and things like that. And then it's a very like easy slope into actually, you wanna now write a script for your site. You wanna now like start doing that. And then you start learning, you can start learning code that way quite easily. I think I've seen many people doing that, especially on like the advanced, when they need to push it a bit further, which I'm sure we'll get onto. Yeah, I didn't say there's a one versus the other. Yeah, it's just an abstraction. When somebody comes to, like a learner comes to MakerPad, what kind of difference are they generally seeking in their lives? Have you noticed patterns? Like what are they trying to accomplish or what difference are they trying to achieve? It definitely was the people who were told, oh yeah, cool idea, you should go like learn to code or go find a technical co-founder. It's generally what the sort of ideas people usually are in the conversation of, let's start a startup. Hey, you talk to your friend and say, I've got a really good idea for a startup. I'm not technical. I'm not sure how to build it. I'll go to an agency or whatever. It's like sort of at that point, no code to me should be the first thought of thing to do. I've got this idea. It's basically behind the hood, exactly like Airbnb. There's a form, there's a email sequence. There's like a UI where you can filter stuff. The first thing shouldn't be, I need to save $100,000 to hire a developer to do it. It shouldn't be, I'll start learning to code. In nine months, I'll be able to build a really shitty version of this. It should be, let me just spin this up and see what it looks like and how it could actually work. So I think it's like what we said before with copying or borrowing features and things from other companies, lots of websites could be grouped into very similar mechanics, right? Like Egghead and Makepad could broadly be put into the same category of a learning platform. Yours is built with code. Ours is built with no code. They still do similar things or have similar features. Obviously, we don't have as advanced features, but it's still like I can spin that up quite quickly and it's the same for most ideas, really. It took me six years to learn how to program computers, not nine months before I was able to do something like Egghead. So I think that's a good point. And it's interesting to me because over time, we've actually migrated away from the code maximalists and used more kind of no low-code tools because our entire team isn't multi-decade experienced programmers and it's like if they want to add to it or build it, it's like it opens it up to them as well, which is another kind of interesting advantage of just these services, because they're taking patterns, right? Like I assume, and that's what we're talking about is these patterns. Here's the general shape of a learning platform. So we can combine these services and you get that shape and you're going to end up with some customizations maybe that you can't do or need to expand on, but you can get to that MVP, right? Like this point of being able to produce something and ship it into the world without needing all that kind of overhead up front and actually see if people are interested, because I think that's a big, like the underlying theme too, is like if you build something and nobody cares and you've wasted $100,000 and two years of your life making something that nobody's even interested in, that's a different discussion, but it's also, it hurts pretty severely to do that and it happens all the time. Yeah, I think that's an interesting thing that I've been thinking about where I don't know if no-code is sort of a two-sided coin in that conversation because I could build something in an afternoon or a weekend, ship it on a Monday, no one gave a shit all week and everyone gave terrible feedback and said, this is awful, like you need to change this. I'd had that weekend's worth of emotional attachment to that project, whereas if I was coding something for six years, I'd be saying this has to work, like, or you're 200 grand in with a development team, you're thinking this has to work and you're then going to not quickly pivot or be more open to feedback, you're probably gonna be thinking, no, no, this is, the idea I built was this, this needs to work, no matter if the market would tell you differently. So that's like, you can give up on those projects quite easily, but again, I think to be a successful entrepreneur, there is a perseverance, but also you probably need to be a bit clued up and like seeing the signs either way, it's like, is this worth persevering or do I need to change this? Have you noticed people's kind of worldviews or how they approach problems, changing as they come into MakerPad and go through your curriculum and come out of the other side, how have people changed in practice? Yeah, so we do like a survey as they come in, we have a cohort course, I'm sure we'll get on to, so we do a survey at the start saying things like, how confident are you with knowing what tools to build your idea, if you have an idea, what tools you need to build them or coming up with those ideas or knowing how to put them together or like building them and actually putting them out in the open. And the scores change pretty dramatically from when they come in to when they finish, because we try and make people ship, like ship shit stuff, like that's what we say, just build crap, like just build anything, because you need to have those reps and that feeling of, I've put something together, I've put it out there, cool, like that's not gonna go anywhere, a recipe book of just my family meals isn't gonna go gangbusters on the internet, but like I've done it, I've gone through the motions, I sort of understand how to like put them together and then do all that stuff, so then that just becomes a bit of a muscle you start training I suppose, where developers are probably, that's how a lot of them learn as well, you like you build small little chunks of projects over time and then you can put that all together, so that's what we're trying to teach is, it's not actually that scary to do it, but I think lots of people, they probably use a ton of things as excuses to even start that building thing, so we're trying to get over that too of like, no, I've got this one idea I wanna build, so no one wants to do that, so you just don't want it to fail and they could build it, but they're just too scared and I think saying, okay, well, if you think that is your big business idea, I mean, we've seen it from the other side, but like if that's what you think, come up with five or 10 other ones before it, before you get to that, to building that last one then, because that'll change definitely. And like iterating through the process, getting to the end through maybe a more incremental, have you had any like surprise success stories come out of Megapad students where it's just they did something unexpected or otherwise succeeded beyond their own expectations? Yeah, there was a woman in one of our cohorts called Cindy and I hope she doesn't mind if she listens to this, me telling her story, but she's a really like sweet older lady who came and joined one of our cohorts and was like, I have no idea what NoCode is, what any of the tools are, anything, like I don't know any of this. And then she started getting through the cohort and really engaging, really like committing to learning this stuff, building stuff and sharing with the group and everything else so that was awesome to see. And then she joined our last cohort as like a returning student and like in the middle of it, she was like, oh yeah, I wrote this script to get this thing going. And I was like, wait, Cindy, you've like, you've written a script, I can't even write a script. Yeah, I was like, where, that transformation has been like, that's just crazy. That's literally gone from zero to writing your own script for your own website. So that to me, I was just like, that's crazy. I never thought we- That's like a whole world of opportunity too, right? Like that's completely changed the like roadmap of what they can produce. It's like a new superpower at the end of the day. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, yeah. And I think there's lots of things like that. There's a couple of people who sort of collaborated together then they started launching products. One of them was like number one on product turn and all of these types of things that are like, I think for big business people, it's like they seem like small wins and they are small wins. But I think you need, I mean, I must have had 50 product launches under my belt before anything really actually stuck. So I think you need those wins, however small or big to get there really. So you mentioned cohorts and I think there's a lot of different ways you can approach like participation, like active learner participation. And like on Egghead, it's totally self-paced. Go in there and you watch it like Netflix and then there's like live workshops and cohort based and what y'all have focused on cohort based and how has that contributed to the success of learners coming into MakerPad? I think it's really difficult because I think cohort based courses had or are having their moment. In a world of everyone is stuck at home on Zoom, people wanted like a connection. So I think it all timed very nicely with, oh, I've got a cohort and I've got a cohort and I've got a cohort and I've never done one. So when we started to say, well, we'll just teach one and we'll see what goes and we'll learn from that. And I think we're on our sixth one now and they are interesting. I don't know, like I can't tell which is my favorite like path of education to have as a business. I can't, I don't know if it's self-paced because there's all the talk about non-completion rates and all of that stuff or whether I like the live element because like sometimes it's up to the group whether how successful that cohort is. If that cohort are happy to be quiet and not share and not really wanna like dive in like Cindy did, then it can be a lot quieter. And it's a hard job. It's very taxing to like do a five week cohort, be sort of the entertainer every session and go get people in and go do icebreakers. You're gonna like try and force that connection straight away. So they're interesting, but the people who do commit to them get so much out of them like Cindy that you can't argue with that. I don't know if she would have got there had it not been for the live cohorts. Like when it works and you have active participatory learners like that's where the magic happens and you can get something really special and kind of evolve out of that. But if it's a bunch of people that aren't really into it, then it probably is just, it's almost sad at that point I would think or just difficult, right? Like it's just hard to get a room of people that don't wanna talk to talk and opening that up. And I think there's a challenge in facilitating too. And I liken it to Dungeons and Dragons a lot of times where you have to, the game master, the person running it, that's setting up the module, doing the research and showing up and getting everybody else interested is like the key to everybody's success and bringing those people in and all that stuff. And that often works, but sometimes it's not enough and that's a real challenge for sure. Yeah, and I think, yeah, they just group people and actually monthly.com, they've got a bunch of different courses and I think the Casey Neistat one is on now and I signed up to it just to sort of see behind the hood of what that cohort looked like. So there's no live elements there, but they group you with like a group of 20 others. And I think it's what you're saying, it's sort of just, you're giving the impression that straight away, you have a connection with these other people, you have a sort of almost a duty to get involved so they don't feel let down and you're helping each other out. So that accountability and connection is happening, it's just not that forced live, we're here now on a Tuesday at 9 a.m. to like putting you into breakout rooms. So I do wonder how, does that live Zoom breakout bit need to be happening or is it actually just, if you connect people together in a group, like through Discord and Slack and all of that stuff then? You know, like, and I think that there's, you know, like there's, they're both are valid and there's, you know, like, if you can do that and you can provide and you help some people and people sign up and that works, that's great. I am curious, like, what's something I'm very curious about, do you have like a formal instructional design philosophy or strategy or prior like influence in that space? I don't actually, like I've read that question and thought I should come up with a good answer for this for just in general life, I should have one, like I feel like I should have looked into that, but I just, I haven't at all, I just, I've done whatever I thought I would have wanted to see someone else do and that's how like MakerBag came together and building it and I just, again, copied from other people, I think I saw, it was a guy's name, Chris from Go Rails, was like one of the sites I saw and I said, well, oh, someone could live stream, that like can screen record their stuff and just talk over it and put that up and behind a paywall, that's a business, he's making like 15 grand a month at that time, so that's how I started saying, I'll just do the same, I'll do a short video tutorial like that and then you just see those patterns out like on other sites but I haven't really sat down and thought of that myself. And you're not alone and when we started AKEhead up through just even a few years ago, that was kind of our approach and for me, if you want a very pleasant and kind of thorough and world-class introduction to that space, Kathy Sierra's badass is absolutely, her book, Badass Making Users Awesome, is the best like instructional design primer that exists, it is fantastic and really a great way to kind of open up into that. Yeah, so I'll look up that because I think, I wonder if, like to me, it's always been a feeling of, this is how I learned, so this is how I think we should teach it to be taught, like this is how it should be taught and then it's just been through, yeah, whatever I thought people do differently, people always do differently, people always don't read and people always don't, people skip things and it's just things like that that sort of throw you off a bit and think, oh, so we actually changed that thing because we thought this, but people don't work like that or think like that and just assume this, so something changes that way, but I'll read that book definitely. Yeah, another recent favorite is Rob Fitzpatrick's, he has, it's called the Workshop Survival Guide and How to Write Useful Books and Rob's done this amazing job of really capturing a lot of this kind of theory and practical ways too, that it's fun when you've been doing this for a long time and then you can read something that's like, wow, like startlingly accurate and I wish I had this 10 years ago, kind of smack in the face and that's what he's done. So you're sitting around and you decided to build your own platform instead of just using something off the shelf because there's platforms like Teachable and Podia and these sorts of things and you went for it and built your own platform and what was kind of the trigger to DIY and I'm assuming you're kind of using your no-code tools and stuff too in the process to do that, but like what made you decide to build a platform instead of grabbing something off the rack? I mean, I think part of it initially was, it's a challenge for me to build, I'd like to, I'm teaching people how to build stuff with no-code, I can't just use something off the shelf, I've got to show that the thing that they're using to learn no-code is the most impressive thing they've seen with no-code, like I needed to sort of talk my own game and I don't know if I just, when I had the skills to build what I feel like was anything at the time, like I know no-code, I can do anything, I feel like I can build this platform myself. You always automatically think, oh, I want to do this thing, I'll build that, I can just build it, I'll just build that whole thing, exactly how I want to do it and it'll be the exact things I want and then when you try and use something else that is the tool that has been built for that thing, you're like, oh, I just wish that was slightly different because I would have done it like this and I'm trying, I've been trying to like stop saying I'll just build it and then actually building it, like I've tried to stop myself doing that because there are all these tools out there that do the right jobs for a lot of these things and a lot of them need to be like 80% of what you would have thought anyway but often it was things that I just wanted a bit more control over exactly how it would look, exactly where certain things would go and yeah, some of it was just testing myself but yeah, there's tons of, I mean, we use Disco now for our cohorts. We did our first cohort with just Airtable, Slack, Notion and that's how we did it. We just had the content in a Notion doc and that was like set up that way. So, I mean, there's so many different ways to do it too but yeah, we use Disco for that, for the cohort piece now.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"Yeah, I was going to ask, I was wondering if you're starting today and you're going to build, you're going to launch a course or launch a learning platform of your own design to teach your expertise, how would you approach it today that might be different from how you approached it when you first started thinking about MakerPen? Well, I found out yesterday, I sent a video to my team yesterday, that Google has something called Google Classroom, which lets people sign up, take your course, assignments, submit them, you can mark them, there's comments on there, you can have any type of media in there, YouTube videos, text, all of that stuff, all basically free and it all looks quite clean and nice and it's an easy sign-in experience because it's not another thing someone has to sign into necessarily, a lot of people will be able to sign in easily to that. I couldn't believe that I just, being someone who has a course platform, I just had no idea that that existed and that would have, to me, if I was doing that tomorrow, I'd probably just set something up in that, have a landing page in Webflow, when you've paid, you get an email that links you to that Google Classroom and that's how I do it. My child's Montessori school actually uses that and I never, before you just mentioned it, thought about using it for anything outside of my child's Montessori school communications that we have to use as parents. That's pretty wild, actually. I'm going to check that out for sure, that's great. The other thing, I love Notion and we've been using Notion as a prototype platform, so when we're beta testing courses and doing that sort of thing, we'll just put it in Notion and have the content there because people can leave comments and do stuff and it's great, but that's definitely an interesting option and I assume, I don't know, that's probably something that evolved out of the whole global situation too, that they've put resources into that and kind of bringing some of that back into the Google sphere. Yeah, they must have. We do the same with our content before it's ready, it's all in Notion. Everything's like a toggled lesson and you just go through it that way. It's very easy to just do that and get feedback and tweak stuff, so that's how we plan it. I've got very generous guest policies too. Cost is an issue and in a lot of these platforms, you start talking about Airtable and stuff and it gets extremely expensive if you're bringing a lot of people into it and Notion has one of the most generous and just kind of useful guest approaches that I've experienced. I wonder at some point if they'll change that. Yeah, I think it was less so like this previously and then they've made it more open. I guess, because they know people are going to sign up. What's a challenge that stands out over the years so far running a learning platform? I don't know if it's a very good business. I don't know if running a learning platform is a very good business. To me, it feels like you either have to go the route of something like Udemy, where you have an open thing. People can put their own courses up, you take a cut, you get loads of venture money to build this huge platform and it's very transactional. You're just trying to get people in and you're taking cuts from other people. $9.99 this week. Yeah, exactly. It feels like there's quite a few of those types of platforms. There's the other side, which is more, I guess, where we are, which is Code Academy, Egghead. Those types of platforms are more, this is a single site, you sign up, you learn here. Seems like acquisition is often a path in that realm. Yeah. It happens. Yeah. Lots of these get swallowed up and bought. We were bought by Zapier, but we're allowed to do our own thing and run independently because it's not. I was happy to see not a lot of changes, actually, after your acquisition. Yeah. We're not a Zapier training tool and they don't want us to be a Zapier training tool. That's not the point of what it is and why we joined forces. But to me, I just felt like learning is a very difficult thing to monetize because if I'm ... You want subscription revenue because you want predictable revenue, but I never wanted to do subscriptions because I just didn't want the headache of thinking, who's going to churn? Why are they going to churn? How can I stop them churning? Because I felt like it was almost wasted energy thinking and trying to stop that. I've never tried because I agree with you and we're a subscription service and I've never focused on churn. It's like- Yeah. I feel like it would just eat you up and think, I'm spending so much time trying to stop someone from churning this year and they might do it next year and I've got them and you're thinking all that stuff. So to me, I was like, it's odd. And also, if I sign up to learn something and it'll charge me again next month, if life gets in the way, my job, kids, whatever it is, and I haven't done something, am I going to pay for it next month? No. I'm just going to cancel it straight away and think, right, I'll just do that. I'll pick that up again when I've got time and it'll just be the same cycle might happen. I might sign up three times. So that feels like an odd thing to me because we never did monthly subscriptions. We did a lifetime plan, which was me thinking, I don't think people would stick around for two years or more initially. So I'm going to charge them over what two years will cost. So then we get that revenue up front. It's good for cashflow when I'm bootstrapping. And that's sort of how we started. We just started with a lifetime and started increasing that up to like $600. And we then introduced a yearly subscription as well because people were asking for it. And then that was like $200 and it's one of those things that I just find, again, if I haven't used something in that one year or I can't remember hanging around in MakerPad building stuff with no code for a considerable amount of time that year, I'm going to renew my Netflix and everything else first. And then I'm not sure, maybe I will do MakerPad. I've learned my no code stuff now and maybe I don't need it. So we're always battling with that, or I certainly was. And I think we almost want people to graduate and say, yeah, you know how to use no code now. Well, they met their goals or whatever that they started out with. They wanted to build a business or they wanted to do something in their life that was different. And they've achieved that. And completing new courses doesn't necessarily add to that original goal that they set out to achieve to begin with. Yeah. And those people, if we then start building tutorials for that sort of person who have graduated, they don't have to build something like MakerPad. They want to deal with webhooks, APIs, and all of this really complex niche stuff for advanced no coders, which is the nichest of the niche things. But yeah, you're just serving a small amount of people, whereas what I did early on was just I built tutorials as I was learning. My tutorials were getting more advanced as I was getting more advanced in my teaching. And then I was like, wait a second, I forgot everyone who never heard of no code before. So we're trying to make sure that we are now getting the biggest piece in that front weight, that piece, and just have enough that people who can build stuff just want to stick around to build stuff and talk about, oh, that's impressive. I like figure this thing out rather than I'm here to learn the next thing. What's next? Yeah. And I mean, like with Egghead, our kind of business model is predicated on the fact that there's a constant churn in the space and web development is ever evolving. And there's always something new to learn to stay ahead of where you're at. And it works. And we've avoided being gobbled up over the years and kind of intentionally on my part, I've chased away potential investors for years and years just as a stubborn refusal and working on the problem myself. I want to go back because it is a good business, but it is not like a guaranteed business, right? Like you can sit down and you can build an education company and succeed, or you can launch a course and succeed. You don't have to build an entire company or platform, right? Like you can just like teach what you know and put it out there on the internet and have some measure of success. It's just how you measure that. And whether it's revenue or helping as many people as possible, like there's all sorts of ways to kind of slice up the idea of success. One thing I wanted to, I thought was interesting, you're talking about subscriptions and going back and like, how do you price things? Cause that's always a very, you know, like how much do I charge per month? How much do I charge for this? And like over the years, over, you know, almost a full decade of doing this and having a subscription business, like at this point we know like the customer lifetime value, right? Like, and you take the customer lifetime value and multiply that by, you know, 50%, like add 50% on top of that. And instead of a subscription, why not just a subscription? And instead of a subscription, why not just charge a flat fee, right? Like you end up like, just give them the lifetime cause then they can just access it whenever. I mean, that really struck me. I saw that somebody said, well, if you know the customer lifetime value, why not just charge that up front instead of, you know, like dealing with the recurring billing and all that. And I thought that was a really interesting way to think about pricing versus, I don't know, people expect it to like, people expect subscriptions or expect a certain thing. And you know, like if you're not giving that and they want it, then like, sure, here, here you go and sign up. And it is, but pricing is very difficult. Like, what is this work worth? And what is it, what kind of value is it bringing to them? And like, in your case, if somebody succeeds at MakerPad, right? Like if they succeed in doing what they set out to do, the like return on their initial investment, whatever hundreds of dollars that is, is, is just bonkers. Like, I think I, I credit Amy Hoy's 30 by 500 for a lot of our kind of way we established our business early. And, and I remember having like a family meeting about the $1,200 that course costed. And we just like this year broke the $30 million in revenue mark for a $1,200 course that kind of like was the spark that ignited the entire thing. And to me, it's like, that's amazing, but it's like, that's also, you know, if you look at the bell curve, it's definitely on the outlier side of it. Most people just kind of drop out at the, like, never really doing anything side of it. So always a fun balance. Yeah. I mean, yeah. The price and stuff is crazy. And that's, that's just how I thought about it. I was like, well, would I want to have to like sign up for something for hundreds of dollars a year? I was like, oh, I just pay once and that'd be awesome. I think I've seen a few like makers do it. I think Peter Levels with Nomad List tried it. And yeah, I just, I thought, well, I think people would stick around for like, they'll maybe do two years. But I think after that, it'll be a struggle to keep them here for the reasons I outlined. I think that, yeah. So we said, okay, well do two years plus a hundred dollars, have that as a lifetime. If people are happy to pay that, I've not forced them to, I've given them the yearly option. And it was just overwhelmingly people would do lifetime. They would just, it was like 60, 70% would do lifetime. And often it's the people who are doing yearly sign up, get the video they wanted, and then they're off. That's all they wanted anyway. So yeah. I tell you what I will not do again is a subscription site with a royalty aspect. That adds a whole financial twist to the entire thing with an ever-growing roster of content and folks that you pay it out. That's been what you end up having is that you end up building an accounting platform versus the stuff you actually want to look at. And when I had that realization that I had built an accounting platform, I was really, I never set out to do that. Never in my life would I set out to build an accounting platform. They exist and bless them for their service. But yeah, it's an interesting realization when you wake up one morning and realize what you've built. Yeah. I bet you were thrilled. Don't want to say I'm happy to hear you say that, but I am happy to hear you say that because so many times I looked at the how to produce on Egghead site, just copied and pasted all of your stuff, put it into Notion and thought, right, we're going to have a platform similar. We'll pay out people. That's how we can get content in. This is how we're going to do it. And I was always, always trying to figure out a way that that could work. And I was like, it just feels too messy and it feels too difficult. And I just, especially, I think probably the blessing of the no code stack then was, well, you're really going to have to stick all these things together and it's going to probably break quite a lot. And you're going to have to maintain this. And I was too lazy to think I'm happy to do that. And we just never, never went down the path of we'll do royalties. So now you saying that I'm like, okay, good. That was a good, either forced like obstacle that I took. So yeah. Yeah. And it's like, there's a, there's a whole, there's this thing called the ethical pool, like royalty pools are flawed just by nature and you can search ethical pool and it's mostly related to music and like Spotify streaming. And as the pool grows, it dilutes and like, it's a whole, it's like a math mess at the end of the day and, you know, like getting into math messes. And we just like took Spotify's algorithm is how we originally did the, the, the Royal and it's still how it is today. And it's been versus the other approach that we take where it's like, we, we have a course product and it's a partnership with a single person. So, and, and the one-off sale and using that one-off sale price instead of a subscription where with a subscription, you, you know, like it's every month you're having to pay a bunch of people based on a percentage versus like one-off sales where it's like, okay, we sold the X dollars a month. You get your cut, we get our cut. Thanks for doing business has been great. And it's a lot less complicated than the, the, like creating a, a marketplace royalty driven marketplace, which has been an interesting challenge and I'm still all for it and we're going to continue. But as we kind of spin up other, other products and using the same methodology, that's one thing that we've, we've dropped to the wayside because it's, it's really quite complex. And, you know, is there a no code accounting platform? I don't think so. Like you're going to be full code at that point. And so, yeah, exactly. It just sounds like a, sounds like a headache. That's a, this is my last question. And I want to know, like, at what point do you hit the limits of no code? Have you hit those limits? And when do you have to, you know, break it out and, and start like building custom or, or is it something you think you can get away with perpetually? I mean, you can get away with it for a long, a long time, I think. And I think it's a lot longer than people think. I mean, we're three years, yeah, three years old. Oh, you know, that's not a long, that's not a long life cycle for a business. Yeah, I guess. And that like tens of thousands of users, like hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue, nothing's ever, like the site's never gone down for any reason other than like a cloud flare issue or whatever. Things, things break, but like they do on every side, there's bugs here, there and everywhere. But we did have a point where, so we use Webflow and we use SCMS for all of our tutorial content. And things are slow on our site because we just have so much content and it's just, yeah, it's slow. But as our like maturity as a company, the amount of content and stuff was increasing over time. So Webflow is getting better over time too. And they're trying to, they want you to be able to do everything without code because that's, there's no better, like there's no better promo for their business to say that this whole thing's built on Webflow. So they're always working on new things and they got a membership beta out now and all of that stuff to help like sort of relieve some of the other tools added to the stack. But we, yeah, because of the, because we had the CMS, we had all of our users in that CMS because I was desperate and adamant to have everyone have a public facing profile so you could show what tools you've used and what tutorials you've completed and all of that stuff. They just wanted that really, really badly. And the only way we could figure it out was to have the Webflow CMS. And then we got to the 10,000 CMS limit. Then we had to think, right, well, what are we going to do? Because just, we can't do this. I hired a developer and we worked on sort of linking the Webflow site with Firebase. So then there was like one profile page and it was like dynamically being rendered by data on Firebase. So we tried that for a bit as well. And then it was just like, well, it turned out no one was really using the feature anyway. It was just something I was adamant to build. I wanted that thing. It felt like one of the things that had to be in a platform like ours. So we got rid of that and then we're back to all no code at the moment and still haven't ever figured out the profile piece of where we would do that. So when Webflow said the membership stuff, that was exciting. But yeah, we'll see how that goes. But yeah, you can build a lot of things with no code. I think it's, I'm not going to pretend that you can do everything because I don't want a load of developers that's coming after me. But you can certainly do, you can run a successful business. You can run like millions of dollars through it. There's like, there's so much you can do other than like just MVP website up and people can give you their email. It's like, it's so much more than that. So I don't want, I don't like when people just sort of brush it off as that. But yeah, there's, we're always going to need developers. We need the developers to build the tools that we're using. Yeah. I mean, the no code itself is going to need an army of developers behind the scenes doing that for sure. I think like in particular, if you're talking about building course platforms or delivering like an educational content, or if you're an expert and you want to like share your knowledge and charge people an entry fee, I think like the no code stack has so like that level of application development is very prime for the space and something like even now, as I'm thinking about starting up another, like my own course and thinking about what platform and I have, you know, this, this bespoke platform I built, I'm intentionally not using my platform and tools that I've had at my disposal and thinking about it like, okay, I want to do this. Like, how would I do this if I didn't have all that at my disposal? And that's kind of where this conversation actually stemmed from is like, I want to like think about building and teaching, you know, from the perspective of, I don't have a bunch of, you know, like a full stack that I've, I've just, I've, I've sunk millions of dollars into building a stack. And, and I love it. And it's very effective, but like, what would I do if I didn't have that today? And, and, and, you know, like in 2022. So that's, that's been an approach I've been thinking about too. And it's, it's really cool to see what you built and what other people are building and can build without getting into, you know, like opening up a code editor and the terminal and firing up Postgres databases and doing all that stuff. It's really fascinating to me and awesome, actually. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. Yeah. And I mean, I think of that every probably three months, much to the delight of my team. It's, if we were going to start this all from scratch, if we, if we deleted everything, what would we do? Are we teaching things in the right way? Should we do this? Should we do that? So we are actually making some changes soon because I've even seen things like Free Code Camp is just such a simple, I can see their CMS structure would be so simple because everything's class is the same type of content. They've got their like structured curriculum and it's just even things like student directory just takes you to LinkedIn. Like you don't have to build your own. I said this earlier, but you don't have to build the thing. Not everything has to be built from scratch and has to have all of your touches on it. I'd say probably build from scratch and probably, you know, like, like do what you want. I'm not telling anybody how to live their lives, but like you can make your life a little easier and maybe like value to the people you're trying to help in the first place quicker and like prove out your ideas and reach what you have set out in terms of success in a way that, I don't know, isn't as painful or expensive or time-consuming, you know, kind of get on with your life. Yeah, but I think again, it's one of those procrastination things that people use to say, no, this, this platform is different. No, this, the course I'm trying to do is actually very different to what other like Teachable and all these others can, can give me and it won't be the same unless it can be this way and really know your idea is not that unique. Just get on with it and use the tools on there. That's yeah. I am a snowflake, Ben. I really appreciate it. I thank you. Thank you for building MakerPad and kind of enabling this because I think it's a value add to the world and I hope more people like get in there and explore and build and create using these tools because it's, it really does open up a lot of opportunity. I really appreciate it. Thanks very much. Yeah. Thanks for having me. I really appreciate it.\")\n",

      "Transcription(text=\"new. And this is, I think this is crucial. If you're always trying to teach something new, then you are always learning. And you are always practicing the craft. And you basically pass the new skills to people. And this is nothing to be afraid of, because a lot of people are like, for me, I wouldn't teach blockchain right now. But I think I could. I mean, I could pass the information that I've learned through the period of these three weeks. And I think that having all the background that I have, the technical background, and I mean, in tech for years now, this actually gives me the confidence to pass this knowledge and teach this new topic, even if I'm not the best, you know, expert in blockchain. But I feel that I would be better suited to sympathize with the people who are just starting out and they will learn a lot from me. So you've built, you have multiple course platforms, and one of them is learnux.io. And it's a great place for folks that are interested in UI design tools, and it's full of video courses. And I'm wondering, how did you describe LearnUX? So LearnUX is a platform for UI and UX designers who are willing to learn some new skills and tools that are like pretty hot in the space right now. And this is a library that I've created quite a few years ago, I guess in 2018. Since then, I've updated it a few times. I feel that this project is like for me, it's complete. I could, now I can record, you know, new courses because there's always something new in the UX and UI space. But sometimes this is an example of a project that I just let it go for some time. And I always come back to this product that I create after some time. I try not to burn out too much. I've created this and I felt that it served many people. And then I have, when I have the real urge to go back to the project, I'm just, you know, I have this real passion to put in. So basically that's why also you told that this is one of my, a lot of different projects that I run. And I run SaaS businesses. I also create my own apps. I have my info products like LearnUX, and also I have a big portal with courses for Poland. And this is basically the great way for me to, to not to burn out and to have some space that would enable me to get new energy. And for example, for LearnUX, to go back to this project from time to time and create really great materials. So also maybe this is a realization that I have now that sometimes it's not like the course or the course that you create, the teaching process sometimes is, this shouldn't be a full-time job because you can easily, you know, probably run out of, maybe not ideas, but run out of energy quickly. I feel like I kind of fell in that trap with Egghead where I was trying to like, just, it was everything, right? I'm doing this one project, it's Egghead, and it just gets monotonous almost, and you lose perspective and it affects that, that product because it's your only thing you're focusing on. And for me, I've recently split off and started working on several products and it feels, it feels more interesting because I circle back and they're all related to each other in some form or fashion. But like this ability to like circle through various interests keeps your brain fresh when, you know, like you're working on this long-term. And it's like, for me, it's like for, I'm going to be working on these products for a long time and how do I bring my best self to them? And that's been a kind of a nice thing to be able to have multiple things to work on. Yeah, that's great. Right. And you always have this new levels of energy when you come back. And sometimes it's like, for example, for me recording a new course or creating a new material, it's like, I'm not recording until I have like this itch, until I'm like, okay, I have to record right now. Okay. If I don't have this feeling, I prefer to, you know, switch to some other task or maybe create some more examples, some more materials, learn some more. And this might be also a tip for people who want to, you know, jump into the studio. Many times we have studios here in Warsaw and we record many courses and you know, people come to the studio and I feel that they are not ready. Most of them are not ready to record. In order to record, you have to be like, oh, I have to let this out. Okay. You have to have this approach and this enthusiasm. And if this is not the case, if you think, oh, I can create a course on this and that, but so let's go to studio or maybe, you know, turn the mic on and see what happens. It's always frustrating. It's always a really bad process. But when you spend a lot of time creating the content and you feel this itch and you feel like, okay, I have to, I just have to tell it. I just have to pass this knowledge to people. Otherwise, I don't know. I forget what I wanted to say because it's too much and stuff like that. Then you have this great material and then you can have this fresh energy, right? You get the, and you also get it from this different projects of yours, right? When you work on different projects, you get so many ideas on what to teach. You know, you learn something basically every day. And this is so great about, you know, online projects as well. One of the things that's interesting is that LearnUX and Eduweb, both custom platforms, you built your own platform. And I was wondering what was missing from the kind of existing white label platform, had you decide to make your own platform to deliver your courses? Yeah, everything was missing. Yeah, it was really, it was really a painful experience, you might say, to develop the platform from the ground up. And we've basically never finished, you know, like, it's like, it's like, I could probably. Yeah, every day, something to do. Yeah. So, so it would be so much better and the world would be so perfect if I could just take the solution that's already there on the market, just build on top of it, and then only have to worry about, you know, recording great courses. So we were trying to, I was trying hard to find solutions that would be okay for me. And me being perfectionist, unfortunately, I could never find the solution that was perfect for, you know, learning platform. And basically, I feel that there is, it's really hard to find it even nowadays, we've been working on this different platforms for like, maybe 10-15 years now. And we came up with all the custom things that that we've developed, like, like the payment process and subscriptions and the player itself. So why is that? Well, I think that there's no one great way, again, what I tried to do, probably all my life, the biggest mission of my life is to create this learning experience, this online learning experience, better than the experiences that you have in class. And, and I truly believe that. But I still feel that no one has done it yet. And I feel that I want the mission to do it. So I tried to just come up with all of the different ideas that will bring me closer to this goal. And this is how I'm trying to rebuild all the things from the ground. I always question myself, you know, why is, for example, the most important part of your online learning experience when it's video course, why is this player, video player, just, you know, blank rectangle for all the other things on the website, like it's not connected to the learning experience at all, you have the video, but it's not connected to the notes you take to the experience. That's why we came up with this cue points with tagging with searching the library, because obviously, there is a lot more to learning than just watching the video. And probably that's why maybe that's why we don't have this, maybe this is great way to learn as a beginner now, because there nobody invented the platform that would allow you to quickly scan through the material, search through the transcripts, and the technology is there, but you have to work really hard to connect the pieces together. And I feel that we are getting closer, but it's really hard task. Technology, are they built on the same kind of core? Or are they separate projects? No, they are separate projects. And EdWeb is quite a big project, because it's like it has this database history of like maybe 13 years. And it's a big platform, we have over 200,000 clients on the platform. And we have, you know, our own hosting and stuff like that. It's really complicated. It's really a big project that we've been developing for years now, and we're still working on it. And Learn UX is just like a website that I quickly assembled. And there's not much in terms of like this, you know, whole learning process and experience. However, I feel that it's also valid points to mention that, okay, sometimes you don't really need it. For the purpose of Learn UX, it's okay to have this pretty simple player like embedded Vimeo. And just a simple thing, because people who are taking the courses, they want to go through the material, and they want to just update themselves on the new UI UX tools like Figma or Sketch and something like that. And probably this is like maybe a good way to put it. But if you have bigger platform with many courses, like we have like 700 courses, probably on adweb, you want to have better technology to cross reference the courses, you want to have better transcripts. And there's so much more that you can do. We even we create, for example, we try to engage people who are learning and we try to give them tasks, we have a custom built system that will put them in small groups, and let them have their own mastermind groups. And this is based on the progress in the courses that they have. So if you are a beginner, and you've learned JavaScript, now you're progressing to react, probably I can give you five people that are in the same place and have the same problems. And I can allow you to just meet in person, you know, in a zoom like experience with the specific task from react that you can work on together. And this is so much better than just, you know, having a simple learning experience. But sometimes you really don't need it. Now I've created and I've created a platform right now on Webflow. And it's great. It's Webflow LMS on the Webflow. And it's so great. It allows you to create your own course platform in a matter of minutes. And also it thanks to automations, and thanks to Webflow itself, it allows you to, you know, just customize it to the pixel. And, and this can be great for, you know, a large part of learning experiences. But on the other hand, it will never be something that I want to create, you know, that I take as a goal for me, because I want and I truly believe in the technology, helping solve this, you know, learning problem. And there is a lot of problems. But basically, I believe in changing the landscape with technology, not the better courses, because you can always create a better course. Yeah, but I want to change, change it to the better with technology, because I feel that there is a huge gap in there. I think it's, it's a lot easier to create when there are valid examples. And it's a lot more difficult when you are forging the way and actually creating those examples for other people. So like right now in this space, there is not a lot of advanced examples of these, you know, like learning experiences. And I feel like you are a person that's dedicated to creating those examples that we can look to and follow. And I really appreciate that in terms of your goals and how you approach online learning and, you know, like, like setting these examples and, you know, like this mutual kind of collaboration. And it's asynchronous and it's not explicit, but like, I love that we have these goals, and we're working on them together in a way. Yeah, of course we do. And we are all, you know, looking at different solutions and things that people come up with. And I'm really excited about the technology that's, that's, you know, right now changing the landscape, and it's progressing pretty quickly. And yeah, we can all learn from each other. That's so awesome. That's so inspiring. Greg, thank you so much for hanging out with me today and chatting about this stuff. And I really appreciate the work that you do. Thank you, Joel. And likewise, thanks. Thanks a lot. Cheers.\")\n",

       "\"You've been an inspiration for us with our own platform, and you've built multiple course platforms and deliver really high-quality learning materials to folks. I wanted to kind of kick it off and ask you, how do you approach learning a new complex topic? When you sit down to learn something new, what is your system or approach to learning something complex? OK, first of all, thanks for inviting me here. And this really means a lot to me, because I had fun for years now, and that's pretty cool. So in answering your question, the framework around learning, it's so vast, and it's such a great question, such a great topic to discuss. And for me, it's a bit funny, but it's changing throughout the years, probably. The more I learn about learning, the more I feel that I know. And obviously, there are so many different ways to approach different learning topics and schemes. And this also depends on the topic that you are learning, actually. How I finished, I've enrolled for a blockchain course on Oxford University. This is like an online course with a lot of materials, like maybe 700 to 800 pages of materials. And I finished that in two weeks. So how did I accomplish this? I tried a technique with really fast scanning through the material. So basically, I was scanning 30 pages in five minutes and trying to get the grasp of what are the most important bullet points and things in the material. And then I tried to rewrite it in my own words what I've learned in these five minutes, like scanning really quickly through the material. And I discovered that, for example, this way of learning for me was exceptionally good for this kind of material, where I was like, I kind of knew something about blockchain already, but I wanted to have the systematic approach to learning. And that's why I enrolled. But I figured that quickly scanning through the material, through the text, then putting down some notes, and then discovering what I already know, it just enabled me to basically focus on the things that I don't know that I need to read through carefully later on. So for example, this is my discovery of last month. And it's really amazing how much you can learn about learning when you try and experiment different techniques. And there's a lot of it. I've explored a lot of neurobiology, how it works, how brain works, how you acquire information. And then I tried to test out different solutions. Why I'm saying about this? Because it's a fairly new technique for me. I've never learned this way. I've never approached the material this way. And now I tried. And I was able to maybe do 600 or 700 pages of blockchain material in two or three weeks. And this is simply because of that technique. And the takeaway from here is that there is no one great way to learn. And there are multiple ways to learn, depending on the context, on the material that you're trying to learn, whether you have some basic knowledge of that or not. And yeah, I think that there are many different ways. I mean, I agree. And I love the idea of running experiments with yourself. So you can sit down and try something new or try a new technique. And one thing I'm curious, because blockchain is a vast technical landscape. So you're reading, and you're going through 700 pages of material, and you're taking notes. What's the goal at the end? Or what's the next step after you've consumed this information? I would assume that that approach gives you contextual knowledge and syntactical knowledge, so you understand the vocabulary of the space and understand what you want to do next. So where do you take that? And what's next to, say, implement it, right? How do you transfer that to some sort of project that you're actually working on? Yeah, so I always try to approach a topic with a certain goal in mind. So in this particular case, I enrolled to this blockchain boot camp, or how they say, the program, because I already knew what I want to accomplish at the end. And if I don't know this, I try to figure it out at the beginning. So the enrollment itself, I don't use a lot of courses myself nowadays. I used to do a lot of them, but now it's really, I just digest some random pieces of content. I try to organize them in a scheme. And this is how I learn now, because I have the background. But in this particular case, what I try to accomplish is what I can do in two or three weeks in order to do this and that. And those were really practical things of blockchain. I wanted to create, to learn and create my NFT. I wanted to create my first smart contract. And I wanted to learn about the space, the legal aspects of the space, and running a startup in blockchain. So basically, I put down those three goals. And with these goals in mind, I basically started scraping all the material. But I was doing this quick reviews of the material. And then I was questioning myself whether I understand it. I wrote some bullet points and what I need to expand on. And then I also took some other resources, obviously, not only the material that I had, but I tried to learn as much as I can about the topic that I don't understand. So if I scrolled those 30 pages and discovered that, OK, maybe the minting process of NFTs is something that I don't really understand right now, where I can find more information. And I jump into some rabbit holes of internet learning about Web3 and just reading, but reading about this particular context so that I can rest assured that, OK, I know this part of material well. And I always try to, it's always better to just understand than read and memorize. Obviously, everyone knows that. But it's funny how people, even knowing that, they don't apply it. And the application is pretty simple. You just scan through material, or you read something. And then you ask yourself some questions, or you try to explain this to some other person. This is also one of the best ways to learn, is basically to teach what you are learning. And that's why I love teaching so much as well, because you can learn a lot if you are about to teach someone something. This is a great way to basically learn, and not only to learn, to memorize, but to understand. This is pretty great. I've recently spoke to a guy from Google. And I always ask, I'm really curious about how people learn, how they approach that in the work environment. And I was asking him about how do they have any specific things that are for employee paths for learning, acquiring new skills, and stuff like that. So he mentioned something that's pretty cool. I don't know if it's organization-wide or if it's only for their office. But what they were doing is they could learn for some part of the week, maybe a few hours or maybe more during their work week. But if they were about to learn something, the first thing that they had to do is put in the calendar, let's say in a month, a meeting or a webinar or something for other employees to teach them this particular skill that they learned. So that they had the goal, and they knew that they have to just acquire this skill in a month because there is a meeting coming up or a training that they have to perform. And they basically taught other people the things that they've learned. And I think it's brilliant. It's one of the best ways of learning. You have some goals. You have to understand material correctly in order to teach someone this material. So basically, you won't skip the information that you don't understand. You will try to learn as hard and understand all the topics so that you basically can teach some other people this topic in a month or something like that. This is pretty efficient. I think it's interesting because you mentioned having a goal. And you have a goal when you sit down to learn. And just being curious is a goal, but it's not a very strong goal. So if you're curious and you need a stronger goal, then setting that calendar date would give you a very strong goal for understanding the material truly so you could transfer it to other people, which is a pretty good hack, I think. Yeah, I always do it. It's really important for me. I don't like learning just to gather some random information. If you have a goal in place, if my goal was creating my first smart contract, then you can orient yourself towards this goal, running through all the materials that you have. And that was a pretty great experience for me, this learning session. To be honest, it was probably the first one for a few months that I had. But I wanted to dig as deep as possible and explore the space. And I just booked my time by buying this course, pretty expensive course. So basically, this was my commitment to doing that, because I wanted to do it for at least a year. But I didn't have enough motivation. I read some random information. And then I decided, OK, I need to focus on this very exact topic. I need to write down my goals. And I need to have some kind of commitment. So I basically bought the course and decided that during the period of this course, it was like maybe six weeks. But I only had three weeks to commit to that. I will do everything to learn as much as possible in order to complete and achieve my goal. And it worked out. So you described it as a text course where there's 700 or 800 pages of text that you're reading and scanning. And we both generally produce video courses. And I think that's an interesting, I don't know, phenomenon maybe, where I'm a reader. That's how I generally approach learning is written words. But do you use video courses in your own learning? Is that something? You said you don't take many courses these days. But is video part of your learning process? Yeah, not these days. Not that much. I guess that video is really great for people, more for beginners and people who are willing to basically learn some complex skill using a course, like this organized in lessons. From Eckerd, I've been learning quite a lot the other way. I mean, I had some background in programming as well. So Eckerd is great in a way that I can approach a little bits and pieces of material. And I can have the exact information that I want. And it's more advanced. So it's great. And I've been using this a lot. But the typical approach to courses is you imagine the topic. And then you learn it through 20 or 30 lessons. And this is just not the way it works for me right now. Because I feel that if you have some vast background of information, it's better for you to just read and explore the written information. But oftentimes, I scan through the transcripts of the courses. And it's like reading the video. And it allows to search as well. So it's a great way to find information too. Yeah, I end up in the transcript a lot myself and just kind of scan through it and pick and pull. And I've gotten to the point where I will download MP3s of podcasts and import them into Otter.ai, get the transcript, and then just go through and look at the guests' commentary. Because typically, the host doesn't add a lot for me. And I'm looking to see what the guest has to say. I don't know. I'm a big text-based learner. That's just how I process information quickly, I think. It's efficient for me, I think, is what it really boils down to. Yeah, I think it's, like I mentioned, the way you are learning, it changes through time. Once you have some background knowledge, quite good knowledge of technology in general, for example, then it's so much easier to find the resources that you want. You always know. Because for some people, and this is pretty difficult when you have this knowledge, to go down to the level of people who are just starting out. And this is also the thing that we struggle with trying to create courses for beginners. Because you never know where the line is, what should you explain, and what should you explain in detail. But the fact is that oftentimes, they don't know what to put in Google Search. And you already know it. You know the basics. You know the more advanced stuff. And you just figure out the words, the phrasing that should be put in the search engine. And people who are just at the beginning of their way, they don't know. And they have to learn it. And learning from the video course is a great way to do it. When you hear the words, you memorize them also. Yeah, you can then go to switch to text-based once you get some initial skills. I think it's the difference between known unknowns and unknown unknowns, right? Like, if you know what you don't know is one thing. And you can research that. If you don't even know what you don't know, then how are you going to even start? So you have to have some place where you start. And that's the challenge. Yeah, that's it. What are some qualities of a really good course in general for you? That's a great question as well. I got to ask this question myself a lot during recent years, because I'm obsessed about the course experience in general. But also, I'm a true believer in that courses and online learning can be better than, in many cases, than classroom learning. And we are not there yet. I mean, no one just, you know, I feel that sometimes I get the feeling that half or most of the internet is doing it wrong. And they are just focusing on selling the courses, not actually teaching people stuff. And marketing, right? Like, it's marketing and launching the course more than designing a learning experience that is effective. I feel like I see that a lot too. That's a phenomenon. Yeah, and this is really bad. I mean, this is something that's probably, you know, people are not, they basically learn how to market the courses. When someone is teaching people how to make your own course and stuff like that, most of this is marketing. And once you have the initial traction with your marketing and maybe you pre-sale, make a pre-sale of the course and you figure out that this might be, you know, this might be OK to do it, then you do the course. But the most, the biggest approach is on marketing. And this is pretty sad. And the way I would discover, you know, throughout, I'm doing courses for 15 years now. And I believe I've been in many places where people were pointing me in the right direction, what they expect from the course and what makes a great course. There's obviously no one answer, one great answer, because this depends on many factors. And obviously, who is the author of the course and who you're doing the course for. But sometimes if you think of some general things that make the course the best in class, like the one that I like to take as a student, I think that would be the engagement of the author. It always makes the biggest difference. When the author is engaged in the course creation process and he firmly believes that he has the knowledge that he is willing to learn on how to pass to his audience, not only, you know, randomly putting lessons of his imagination. Basically, the engagement and the energy that the author has is really crucial. And it's the most important factor because I've seen so many courses that were just badly prepared, not taking into consideration just simple things like, you know, attention span on the internet. People, sometimes they try, they, for example, run some stationary classes and they try to create the same course experience online and doing like, you know, 45 minute lesson. And it will never work, you know. It's like the attention span is like five or six minutes and you should keep your lessons concise. And you obviously know that. Many people, they just figure out that, you know, OK, I'm going to do it like I do my class. And this just doesn't work in the internet. So the best courses that I've seen were the ones where the author was really engaged, but not only in passing the knowledge, but also in the creation, the process of creating the course. And there is a lot to be done in this process. Some of my courses, I just spent maybe four or five or six months creating the course, the outline of the course and the materials. Recording itself, I can do it easily. So it's like three or four days. But the whole process of creating the content and creating the best outline for the course and creating the best examples for the course, it's what makes the huge difference. And yeah, there's no one way. But basically, I feel that people are focusing less and less on the content itself and the course design process, which is crucial. And their attention is more on marketing and things that doesn't really matter for the output you get from the course. I think what you're describing to me is like the instructional design process or just the core design. And it's really fundamental to just generally, right, like the idea of design and not in the visual sense. But you have to design for outcomes and the experience of the learner and take that care to truly craft something that is useful to people. And then you get a good course. It's not like, how am I going to sell this to people and how am I going to extract dollars from wallets? It's how am I going to design something that's effective is the question that I think is the place to start. Yes, and you have to often, it's like people figure out that, OK, I'm going to do the course. And they just log themselves for like maybe a month or something and they come up with the course. It never works this way. So what you should do instead is basically, it's like, you know, your course is like, you should treat it like a startup. You should A, B test it. You should ask people. You should interview some folks. When you come up with the lesson, it's always like when I have the lesson idea, I always have some bullet points of what my students will accomplish with this lesson, what I'm going to give in this lesson. And this is pretty crucial. And I feel that sometimes we're missing the most important factor of our courses being our students learning something. And I often, like, I have a group of students when I create the course, I try to enroll as many people as I can in like better testing the course. And when I'm recording, I'm just sending the lessons over. I'm asking them questions. So it's really important to have people that will give you feedback in the process of designing the course. It's super important. Like the course, you shouldn't do it alone, you know, because then you face so many different problems that will end up in poor quality of the course. And it doesn't really matter if you're great in the topic or not, because like we've mentioned, for example, you might not know the difference and the line between beginners and maybe intermediate and users. And you basically will provide information that's not, you know, detailed enough because you won't go to the level of the students because you think that's obvious, because for you it might be, but for them, it's really. So for me, many times, and I've been doing this a lot, but now I find myself working with my students, and of course, some people who help me to create materials and stuff like that, but basically with my students throughout the whole process of creating a course and getting their feedback is really valuable. And oftentimes I wouldn't even imagine that, okay, I should do it, I should do a different example, or I should explain this more in detail and stuff like this. It's too obvious for me, but for them, it's a real problem that they address. I think it's interesting because what you described to me is fundamentally like a product design process, right? Like where the course is a product and you could transfer the same concept and idea to like a SaaS product, for instance, or some other thing where you're taking the care, you're talking to users, finding out what people actually need, and then, you know, designing an experience for them that they will then find useful and pay you for. And I think there's a lot of correlation here just in terms of what you've described. That's it, yeah. That's why I said it's like a startup, but like you mentioned, this is a product design. And many people do it, but they skip the really important parts. So basically, they just do this initial phase of the product. So maybe some checking whether there might be attraction for the product, and they do it pretty well. So create a campaign and some email list, and then they have webinars when they test whether this would work and maybe someone will pre-order the course. And this is great because you can get some insights from those people. But then I think that when they finally see that, okay, this might work out, they lock themselves in a closet for two months and they end up having a product that's not really fitted for the market. Maybe it's treated more like an essay or a term paper than a product at the end of the day. Yeah, I feel, yeah, yeah. You know, like you're writing an essay, basically, and you're not creating a course, you're writing an essay. Somebody will read it and they might get something out of it or not. Yeah, yeah, and you never test. Yeah, and maybe writing a book in a lake house. Yeah. Yeah, but it shouldn't be like this. It should be really like designing a great product that people are willing to pay for. But basically, it's like in a startup, you have to test the ideas and see what the outcomes are. If you're sitting down to research a new course, is your process different than if you were just learning something like you described in the blockchain earlier? When you're describing that, is that research process different when you're approaching a new course? No, I think it's pretty the same because it's all the like learning and teaching experience. It obviously depends on how many things you already know about the topic. The basic question for me is, who am I speaking to? Who am I creating the course for? And when you learn and research the topics, you have that answer in place because it's you, right? So basically, you know this person, so it's easier at the beginning. And most of the people skip that part when they create the course because they create the course as if they created this course for themselves. But many times, they address different audience. Now, they want to address themselves, but maybe from like five years ago when they were starting out or something like that. But instead, they just focus on how would I best learn this thing right now? And this might be a trap. So one of the things I think that's interesting when you start to teach or you're doing this sort of thing or you're developing courses is you get away from the practice, right? Like, so if you were teaching UX design, like how do you keep yourself grounded in the practice of UX design to be able to like confidently teach as an expert? Yeah, that's a great question too. I feel that many people have this, like for a start, they don't know whether they could teach because they know the topic well, but they are not great teachers. And they question themselves, all right, but I'm not the best person to pass the knowledge to anyone because I don't know how to teach. But you can learn how to teach. It's easy. And on the other hand, there are people who basically, they think that they know how to teach or maybe they know how to teach, but they don't know the topic because they teach too much and they lost the connection with the topic itself. And I've always been like what we've done for years now and what I try to do is always have people on board who are the best in class programmers like you do. So those are not teachers who doesn't practice the topic. They are always the best in class. Sometimes not the best in class. You don't have to be the best. Sometimes it's even better if you're exploring the topic, learning the topic, and then you have better connection with people who are actually willing to learn it. But the thing is that you cannot lose this connection to the topic itself. And for example, I've never taught subject twice. That's why I love video courses because you can just record it. And actually, this is how I started doing video courses for a short period in my life. I've been training people in class and I've been teaching them, although it was a long time ago, I've been teaching them ActionScript and Flash. So yeah, but I've run like maybe five classes. And obviously after the fifth class I've run, I felt that there's not much to improve. And I was so bored on the sixth that I've just tried to do it differently. And then I figured that, okay, I can record the sixth approach, which is pretty good. And then I don't have to do it again. So for me, it was always teaching something. new. And this is, I think this is crucial. If you're always trying to teach something new, then you are always learning. And you are always practicing the craft. And you basically pass the new skills to people. And this is nothing to be afraid of, because a lot of people are like, for me, I wouldn't teach blockchain right now. But I think I could. I mean, I could pass the information that I've learned through the period of these three weeks. And I think that having all the background that I have, the technical background, and I mean, in tech for years now, this actually gives me the confidence to pass this knowledge and teach this new topic, even if I'm not the best, you know, expert in blockchain. But I feel that I would be better suited to sympathize with the people who are just starting out and they will learn a lot from me. So you've built, you have multiple course platforms, and one of them is learnux.io. And it's a great place for folks that are interested in UI design tools, and it's full of video courses. And I'm wondering, how did you describe LearnUX? So LearnUX is a platform for UI and UX designers who are willing to learn some new skills and tools that are like pretty hot in the space right now. And this is a library that I've created quite a few years ago, I guess in 2018. Since then, I've updated it a few times. I feel that this project is like for me, it's complete. I could, now I can record, you know, new courses because there's always something new in the UX and UI space. But sometimes this is an example of a project that I just let it go for some time. And I always come back to this product that I create after some time. I try not to burn out too much. I've created this and I felt that it served many people. And then I have, when I have the real urge to go back to the project, I'm just, you know, I have this real passion to put in. So basically that's why also you told that this is one of my, a lot of different projects that I run. And I run SaaS businesses. I also create my own apps. I have my info products like LearnUX, and also I have a big portal with courses for Poland. And this is basically the great way for me to, to not to burn out and to have some space that would enable me to get new energy. And for example, for LearnUX, to go back to this project from time to time and create really great materials. So also maybe this is a realization that I have now that sometimes it's not like the course or the course that you create, the teaching process sometimes is, this shouldn't be a full-time job because you can easily, you know, probably run out of, maybe not ideas, but run out of energy quickly. I feel like I kind of fell in that trap with Egghead where I was trying to like, just, it was everything, right? I'm doing this one project, it's Egghead, and it just gets monotonous almost, and you lose perspective and it affects that, that product because it's your only thing you're focusing on. And for me, I've recently split off and started working on several products and it feels, it feels more interesting because I circle back and they're all related to each other in some form or fashion. But like this ability to like circle through various interests keeps your brain fresh when, you know, like you're working on this long-term. And it's like, for me, it's like for, I'm going to be working on these products for a long time and how do I bring my best self to them? And that's been a kind of a nice thing to be able to have multiple things to work on. Yeah, that's great. Right. And you always have this new levels of energy when you come back. And sometimes it's like, for example, for me recording a new course or creating a new material, it's like, I'm not recording until I have like this itch, until I'm like, okay, I have to record right now. Okay. If I don't have this feeling, I prefer to, you know, switch to some other task or maybe create some more examples, some more materials, learn some more. And this might be also a tip for people who want to, you know, jump into the studio. Many times we have studios here in Warsaw and we record many courses and you know, people come to the studio and I feel that they are not ready. Most of them are not ready to record. In order to record, you have to be like, oh, I have to let this out. Okay. You have to have this approach and this enthusiasm. And if this is not the case, if you think, oh, I can create a course on this and that, but so let's go to studio or maybe, you know, turn the mic on and see what happens. It's always frustrating. It's always a really bad process. But when you spend a lot of time creating the content and you feel this itch and you feel like, okay, I have to, I just have to tell it. I just have to pass this knowledge to people. Otherwise, I don't know. I forget what I wanted to say because it's too much and stuff like that. Then you have this great material and then you can have this fresh energy, right? You get the, and you also get it from this different projects of yours, right? When you work on different projects, you get so many ideas on what to teach. You know, you learn something basically every day. And this is so great about, you know, online projects as well. One of the things that's interesting is that LearnUX and Eduweb, both custom platforms, you built your own platform. And I was wondering what was missing from the kind of existing white label platform, had you decide to make your own platform to deliver your courses? Yeah, everything was missing. Yeah, it was really, it was really a painful experience, you might say, to develop the platform from the ground up. And we've basically never finished, you know, like, it's like, it's like, I could probably. Yeah, every day, something to do. Yeah. So, so it would be so much better and the world would be so perfect if I could just take the solution that's already there on the market, just build on top of it, and then only have to worry about, you know, recording great courses. So we were trying to, I was trying hard to find solutions that would be okay for me. And me being perfectionist, unfortunately, I could never find the solution that was perfect for, you know, learning platform. And basically, I feel that there is, it's really hard to find it even nowadays, we've been working on this different platforms for like, maybe 10-15 years now. And we came up with all the custom things that that we've developed, like, like the payment process and subscriptions and the player itself. So why is that? Well, I think that there's no one great way, again, what I tried to do, probably all my life, the biggest mission of my life is to create this learning experience, this online learning experience, better than the experiences that you have in class. And, and I truly believe that. But I still feel that no one has done it yet. And I feel that I want the mission to do it. So I tried to just come up with all of the different ideas that will bring me closer to this goal. And this is how I'm trying to rebuild all the things from the ground. I always question myself, you know, why is, for example, the most important part of your online learning experience when it's video course, why is this player, video player, just, you know, blank rectangle for all the other things on the website, like it's not connected to the learning experience at all, you have the video, but it's not connected to the notes you take to the experience. That's why we came up with this cue points with tagging with searching the library, because obviously, there is a lot more to learning than just watching the video. And probably that's why maybe that's why we don't have this, maybe this is great way to learn as a beginner now, because there nobody invented the platform that would allow you to quickly scan through the material, search through the transcripts, and the technology is there, but you have to work really hard to connect the pieces together. And I feel that we are getting closer, but it's really hard task. Technology, are they built on the same kind of core? Or are they separate projects? No, they are separate projects. And EdWeb is quite a big project, because it's like it has this database history of like maybe 13 years. And it's a big platform, we have over 200,000 clients on the platform. And we have, you know, our own hosting and stuff like that. It's really complicated. It's really a big project that we've been developing for years now, and we're still working on it. And Learn UX is just like a website that I quickly assembled. And there's not much in terms of like this, you know, whole learning process and experience. However, I feel that it's also valid points to mention that, okay, sometimes you don't really need it. For the purpose of Learn UX, it's okay to have this pretty simple player like embedded Vimeo. And just a simple thing, because people who are taking the courses, they want to go through the material, and they want to just update themselves on the new UI UX tools like Figma or Sketch and something like that. And probably this is like maybe a good way to put it. But if you have bigger platform with many courses, like we have like 700 courses, probably on adweb, you want to have better technology to cross reference the courses, you want to have better transcripts. And there's so much more that you can do. We even we create, for example, we try to engage people who are learning and we try to give them tasks, we have a custom built system that will put them in small groups, and let them have their own mastermind groups. And this is based on the progress in the courses that they have. So if you are a beginner, and you've learned JavaScript, now you're progressing to react, probably I can give you five people that are in the same place and have the same problems. And I can allow you to just meet in person, you know, in a zoom like experience with the specific task from react that you can work on together. And this is so much better than just, you know, having a simple learning experience. But sometimes you really don't need it. Now I've created and I've created a platform right now on Webflow. And it's great. It's Webflow LMS on the Webflow. And it's so great. It allows you to create your own course platform in a matter of minutes. And also it thanks to automations, and thanks to Webflow itself, it allows you to, you know, just customize it to the pixel. And, and this can be great for, you know, a large part of learning experiences. But on the other hand, it will never be something that I want to create, you know, that I take as a goal for me, because I want and I truly believe in the technology, helping solve this, you know, learning problem. And there is a lot of problems. But basically, I believe in changing the landscape with technology, not the better courses, because you can always create a better course. Yeah, but I want to change, change it to the better with technology, because I feel that there is a huge gap in there. I think it's, it's a lot easier to create when there are valid examples. And it's a lot more difficult when you are forging the way and actually creating those examples for other people. So like right now in this space, there is not a lot of advanced examples of these, you know, like learning experiences. And I feel like you are a person that's dedicated to creating those examples that we can look to and follow. And I really appreciate that in terms of your goals and how you approach online learning and, you know, like, like setting these examples and, you know, like this mutual kind of collaboration. And it's asynchronous and it's not explicit, but like, I love that we have these goals, and we're working on them together in a way. Yeah, of course we do. And we are all, you know, looking at different solutions and things that people come up with. And I'm really excited about the technology that's, that's, you know, right now changing the landscape, and it's progressing pretty quickly. And yeah, we can all learn from each other. That's so awesome. That's so inspiring. Greg, thank you so much for hanging out with me today and chatting about this stuff. And I really appreciate the work that you do. Thank you, Joel. And likewise, thanks. Thanks a lot. Cheers.\""
